Sinha (P. K. Bose, with him) for the appel lant.\nN.C. Chatterjee and Panchanan Ghosh (Chandra Narayan Naik, with them) for the respondent. 1950.\nDecember 1.\nThe Judgment of the Court was deliv ered by PATANJALI SASTRI J.\nThis appeal arises out of a suit brought by the respondent in the court of the Subordinate Judge, Dhanbad, for recovery of arrears of royalty and cess from the appellant and another alleged to be due under a compromise decree passed on the 6th March, 1923, in a previ ous suit between the predecessors in interest of the par ties.\nThe only plea which is material for the purpose of this appeal is that the compromise decree not having been registered was inadmissible in evidence.\nThe courts below held that the document did not require registration and gave effect to its terms in decreeing the suit.\nThe second defendant has preferred this appeal.\nThe facts are not now in dispute and may be briefly stated.\nOn 11th March, 1921, one Kumar Krishna Prasad Singh (hereinafter referred to as Kumar) granted a perma nent lease of the right to the underground coal in 5,800 bighas of land belonging to him to Shibsaran Singh and Sitaram Singh (hereinafter referred to as the Singhs) by a registered patta stipulating for a salami of Rs. 8,000 and royalty at the rate of 2a.\nper ton of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs. 8,000 and for certain other cesses and interest.\nOn 7th June, 1921, Kumar executed another perma nent patta leasing the right to the coal in 500 bighas out of the 5,800 bighas referred to above to one Prayngji Bal lavji Deoshi and his son Harakchand Deoshi (hereinafter referred to as the Deoshis).\nBy this document.\n835 the Deoshis agreed inter alia to pay royalty at the rate of 2a. per ton on all classes of coal raised subject to a minimum of Rs. 750 a year.\nThe Singhs feeling themselves aggrieved by the latter transaction brought a title suit (No. 1291 of 1921) in the Court of the Subordinate Judge of Dhanbad for a declaration of their title and for possession of the 500 bighas leased to the Deoshis under the aforesaid patta of 7th June, 1921.\nTo that suit Kumar was made a party as defendant No. 3, the Deoshis being defendants 1 and 2.\nThe suit was however cornpromised on 6th March, 1923, by all the parties and a decree based on the compromise was also passed on the same day.\nThe interest of the Singhs was brought to sale in 193S in execution of a decree obtained against them and was purchased by the plaintiff who insti tuted the presnt suit on 3rd October, 1942, claiming the royalty and cesses payable under the compromise decree for the period from Pous 1345 to Asadh 1349 B.S. from defendants 1 and 2 as the representatives of the Deoshis who entered into the compromise of March, 1923.\nIn order to appreciate the contentions of the parties, it is necessary to set out the relevant terms of the compro mise decree which are as follows : \"The plaintiffs (the Singhs) within two months from this date shall pay Rs. 8,000 as salami to defendant No. 3 (Kumar).\nOtherwise all the terms of the compromise Will stand cancelled and the plaintiffs shall not be competent to claim any right to or possession over the.land covered by the patta dated 11th March, 1921.\nThe patta which defend ant No. 3 executed in favour of the plaintiffs in respect of 5,800 bighas of coal land in village Rahraband shall remain in force, and the plaintiffs will get a decree of declara tion of their right and title to the 500 bighas of coal land in dispute but defendants 1 and 2 (the Deoshis) shall hold possession as tenants.\nBesides the terms mentioned below, defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound by all the remaining terms under which they took settlement of the 500 bighas of coal land from defendant No. 3 under 836 patta and Kabuliyat, and both the defendants 1 and 2 shall possess the same under the plaintiffs from generation to generation and all the terms of the said patta and Kabuliyat shall remain effective and in force between them.\nBoth the defendants 1 and 2 shall remain bound to pay to the plain tiffs commission at the rate of 2a.\nper ton on all sorts of coal instead of 2a.\na ton as stated before in the patta of 5,800 bighas of land settled with the plaintiffs.\nThe plaintiffs shall pay to defendant No. 3 in future the mini mum royalty of Rs. 6,000 instead of Rs. 8,000 as stipulated in the original patta of 11 th March 1921 and commission at the rate of la.\na ton in place of 2a.\na ton as stipulat ed in the patta of March 21 .\nUnless the plaintiffs pay to the defendant No. 3 Rs. 8,000 within 2 months from this day they shall not be competent to take out execution of this decree, nor shall they be competent to take posses sion of the land in dispute.\nThe defendants 1 and 2 within one month from the date of payment of Rs. 8,000 as aforesaid to defendant No. 3 shall execute a new Kabuliyat in favour of the plaintiff in respect of the modified terms stated above, i.e., on the condition to pay commission at the rate of 2a.\nper ton.\nIn the new patta which defendant No. 3 will execute in favour of the plaintiffs he shall embody the condition that the annual minimum royalty will be Rs. 6,000 instead of Rs. 8,000 and commission will be at the rate of la. 9p.\nper ton in place of 2a.\nper ton as mentioned in the aforesaid patta.\nIf the defendant No. 3 does not execute the parts on the aforesaid modified terms in favour 'of the plaintiffs within the time aforesaid and both the defendants 1 and 2 also do not execute a kabuliyat on the aforesaid modified terms, then this very rafanama shall be treated as the parts and kabuliyat, and the plaintiffs in accordance with the terms of the rafanama shall pay to defendant No. 3, Rs. 6,000 only as minimum royalty and commission at the rate of la.\nper ton with respect to 5,800 bighas and shall continue to realise commission at the rate of 2a. 6p. per ton from defendants 1 and 2 who shall remain bound to pay the same.\n\" 837 The answer to the question whether this compromise decree requires registration depends on the legal effect of the changes in the status quo ante of the parties brought about by the document.\nA careful analysis reveals the following alterations : (1) In the lease to the Singhs, the rate of royalty or commission was reduced from 2a.\nper ton of coal raised to la.\nper ton and the minimum royalty was reduced from Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 6,000 while the area of coal land in their khas possession was reduced by 500 bighas. (2) In the lease to the Deoshis the rate of royalty or commission was enhanced from 2a.\nper ton to 2a.\nper ton and tiffs was made payable to the Singhs.\nThe Singhs and the Deoshis were brought into a new legal relationship, the former accepting the latter as tenants holding the disputed 500 bighas under them in consideration of the latter agreeing to pay the enhanced royalty to the former. (4) The whole arrangement was made conditional on the Singhs paying Rs. 8,000 to Kumar within 2 months from the date of the compromise, it being expressly provided that the Singhs were not to be entitled to execute the decree or to take possession of the disputed area of 503 bighas which evidently had not till then passed into their possession.\nNow, sub section (1) of section 17 of the , enumerates five categories of documents of which regis tration is made compulsory which include\" (d) leases of immoveable property from year to year, or for any term exceeding one year, or reserving a yearly rent;\".\nSub sec tion (2) however provided that \"nothing in clauses (b) and (c) of sub section (1)applies to . (vi) any decree or order of court.\n\" It may be mentioned in passing that this clause was amended with affect from the 1st April, 1930, by the , so as to exclude from the scope of the exception compromise decrees comprising immovable property other than that which is the subject matter of the suit.\nBut 838 the amendment cannot affect the document here in question which came into existence in 1923.\nBefore the amendment, the clause was held to cover even compromise decrees comprising immovable property which was not the subject matter of the suit: [Vide Hemanta Kumari Debi vs Midnapur Zamindari Co. ( ')].\nThat decision applies to the present case and obviates the objection that because the compromise in question covered also the remaining 5,300 bighas which were not the subject matter of the title suit of 1921, it was outside the scope of the exception in sub section (2), clause (vi).\nThe only question, therefore, is whether the compromise decree is a \"lease\" [which expression includes \"an agreement to lease\" by the definition in section 2 (7)] within the meaning of el.\n(d) of sub section (1).\nIt is obvious that if the compromise decree fails within clause (d) of sub section (1) it would not be protected under clause (vi) of sub section (2) which excepts only documents falling under the categories (b) and (c) of sub section (1).\nThe High Court was of opinion that, on a proper construction of the terms of the compromise, it did not fall under clause (d).\nMano har Lall J., who delivered the leading judgment, observed: \"It was a tripartite agreement embodied in the decree of the court and was, therefore, exempt from registration.\nIt will be oh.served also that so far as the defendants were con cerned, their possession of the 500 bighas was not inter fered with and they still remained in possession as the lessees, but instead of paying the royalty to the plaintiffs it was agreed between all the parties that the defendants would pay the royalty in future to Shibsaran and Sitcram.\nIf the matter had stood there, the learned Advocate for the appellant could not have seriously contested the position, but he vehemently argued that when the agreement was not to pay the same amount of royalty or commission as previously agreed to but an altered amount of royalty and commission, the document should be held to fall within the mischief of section 17 (1)(d)of the (1) P.C. 839 .\nThe answer to this contention is, as I have stated just now, to be found in the Full Bench decision of this court :\" [see Charu Chandra Mitra 's case ()].\nIt was there held that a mere alteration of the rent reserved does not make the transaction a new lease so as to bring it within clause (d)of subsection (1).\nWe are unable to share this view.\nIt oversimplifies the compromise transaction which, in our opinion, involves much more than a mere alteration of the royalties stipulated for in the previous pattas executed by Kumar.\nNor can we accept the suggestion of Mr. Chatterjee for the respondents theft the compromise operated as an assignment to the Singhs by Kumar of the latter 's reversion under the \"lease granted to the Deoshis and all that the latter did was to acknowledge the Singhs as their landlords and attern to them.\nOn tiffs view it was said that the transaction would not fall under clause (d), although it would fall under clause (b) but then would be saved by the exception in clause (vi) of sub section (2).\nThe argument, however, overlooks that Kumar had leased the area of 5,800 bighas to the Singhs by his patta dated 11th March, 1921, and the compromise by providing that the Singhs should pay the reduced royalty of 1a.\nper ton in respect of the whole area preserved Kumar 's reversion intact.\nHe could not therefore be deemed to have assigned any part of his inter est in 5,800 bighas as landlord to the Singhs who continue to hold the entire extent as tenants under him.\nWhat the compromise really did was.\nas stated already, to bring the Singhs and the Deoshis into a new legal relationship as underlessor and under lessee in respect of 500 bighas which were the subject matter of the title suit; in other words, its legal effect was to create a perpetual underlease be tween the Singhs and the Deoshis which would clearly fall under clause (d) but for the circumstance that it was to take effect only on condition float the Singhs paid Rs. 8,000 to Kumar within 2 months (1) 840 thereafter.\nAs pointed out by the Judicial Committee in Hemanta Kumar 's case (1) \"An agreement for a lease, which a lease is by the statute declared to include, must, in their Lordships ' opinion, be a document which effects an actual demise and operates as a lease .\nThe phrase which in the context where it occurs and in the statute in which it is found, must in their opinion relate to some document which creates a present and immediate interest in the land.\n\" The compromise decree expressly provides that unless the sum of Rs. 8,000 was paid within the stipulated time the Singhs were not to execute the decree or to take possession of the disputed property.\nUntil the payment was made it was impossible to determine whether there would be any under lease or not.\nSuch a contingent agreement is not within clause (d) and although it is covered by clause (b). is excepted by clause (vi) of sub section ( '2).\nWe therefore agree with the conclusion of the High Court though on dif ferent grounds and dismiss the appeal with costs.\nAppeal dismisseel.\n",
    "summary": "An agreement for a lease, which a lease is by the Indian declared to include, must be a document which effects an actual demise and operates as a lease.\nIt must create present and immediate interest in land.\nWhere a litigation between two persons A and B who claimed to be tenants under C was settled by a compromise decree the effect of which was to create a perpetual underlease between A and B which was to take effect only on condition that A paid Rs. 8,000 to C within a fixed period: Held, that such a contingent agreement was not \"a lease\" within el.\n(a) of section 17 (t) of the Indian , and even though it was covered by cl.\n(b) of the said sec tion it was exempt from registration under el.\n(vi) of subs.\n(2) of section 17.\nHemanta Kumari Debi vs Midnapur Zamindari Co.

Shroff, for the respondent.\nDecember 6.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by KAPUR, J.\nThis is an appeal by special leave brought by the Commissioner of Income tax against the judgment and order of the High Court of Bombay answering the question in favour of the assessee.\nThe question referred by the Tribunal was: \"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the amount of Rs. 3,20,162 is an allowable deduction under Section 10(2)(xi) or 10(2)(xv) of the Income tax Act?\" which was amended by the High Court as follows: \"Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the amount Rs. 3,20,162 is an allowable deduction\" and was answered in the affirmative and against the appellant.\nThe facts of the case shortly stated are these: The respondent is a registered firm carrying on business as commission agents.\nIt was treated as the agent of a non resident principal Haji Mohamed Syed Ali Barbari of Port Sudan (hereinafter 'referred to as the nonresident principal.\nIt was carrying on the business of export of cloth and kariana (i.e., miscellaneous goods) to Aden, Saudi Arabia and sudan.\nIt used to supply goods from India to the nonresident principal, who on his part, was sending cotton to the respondent and other merchants for sale in India.\nFor the years 1942 43, 1943 44, 1944 45 and 1945 46, the respondent firm was treated as the agent of the nonresident principal under section 43 of the Income tax Act 951 (which will hereinafter be termed 'the Act ') for the purpose of income tax and Excess Profits Tax.\nThe respondent firm had to pay in all Rs. 3,78,491 under section 42(1) of the Act and after allowing for the amounts which were in its hands the account of the principal non resident showed a debit balance of Rs. 3,20,162.\nFor the year of assessment, 1953 54, the respondent firm treated this amount as a bad debt and claimed it as a deductible loss to be set off against profits.\nThe Income tax Officer treating this claim as one under section 10(2)(xv) of the Act, disallowed it.\nThe Appellate Assistant Commissioner treated it as one under section 10 (2)(xi) of the Act and he also disallowed it.\nOn appeal to the Income tax Appellate Tribunal it was held to be a bad debt and an allowable deduction as it was incurred as a result of the business activities which the respondent firm was carrying on with the nonresident principal.\nAt the instance of the Commissioner of Income tax, the case was stated to the High Court and the High Court modified the question and answered the same in the affirmative, i.e., against the appellant.\nThe High Court held that as the law imposed an obligation upon the respondent firm to discharge the liability and it was incidental to the business of the respondent the amount was a deductible loss; and even if it was not a debt, then also the amount could be claimed by the assessee as a business or trading loss, because in arriving at the true profit of the respondent 's business that loss had to be deducted.\nThe High Court thus applied section 10(1) of the Act to the amount claimed by the respondent.\nThe allowability of the amount in dispute depends upon the nature of the liability imposed upon the respondent firm.\nThe contention of the respondent 's counsel was that it was carrying on foreign trade and had dealings with a foreign merchant and in the course of the business there were imports and exports and therefore the interconnection between the respondent firm and the non ' resident principal was so intimate as to invite the application of section 42(1), i.e., the establishment of agency as 'contemplated in that section.\nThe liability to pay arises under a. 42(2) which provides 952 \"Where a person not resident or not ordinarily resident in the taxable territories carries on business with a person resident in the taxable territories, and it appears to the Income tax Officer that owing to the close connection between such persons the course of business is so arranged that the business done by the resident person with the person not resident or not ordinarily resident produces to the resident either no profits or less than the ordinary profits which might be expected to arise in that business, the profits derived therefrom or which may reasonably be deemed to have been derived therefrom, shall be chargeable to income tax in the name of the resident person who shall be deemed to be, for all the purposes of this Act, the assessee in respect of such income tax.\" Relying on this provision it was argued that the nature of the respondent 's business was foreign trade which was inter connected with the business of the non resident principal.\nIts nature was such as to attract the imposition of liability on the respondent firm under section 42(2) of the Act and therefore the loss so incurred must be taken to be incidental to and arising out of the business of the respondent.\n\"The thing to be taxed\", said Lord Halsbury, L. C., \"is the amount of profits and gains.\nThe word 'profits ' I think is to be understood in its natural and proper sense in a sense which no commercial man would.\nmisunderstand\": Gresham Life Assurance Society V. Styles (1).\nHence even if a deduction is not specifically enumerated in sub section (2) of B. 10 it would still be a debatable item to reflect the taxable profits.\nThe Privy Council in Commissioner of Income tax vs Sir section M. Chitnavis (1) held that the Act nowhere authorises the deduction of bad debts of a business, such a deduction is necessarily allowable because what is chargeable to income tax in respect of a business are the profits and gains of a year and in assessing the amount of profits and gains of that, year account must necessarily be taken of all losses incurred, otherwise true profits and gains cannot be ascertained.\nIn order (1)(1892) , 188 (H.L.).\n(2)(1932) L.R. 59 I.A. 290, 296. 953 that a loss may be deductible it must be a loss in the business of the assessee and not payment relating to the business of somebody else which under the provisions of the Act is deemed to be and becomes the liability of the assessee.\nThe loss becomes allowable if it \"springs directly from and is incidental\" to the business of the assessee.\nThe decision therefore mainly depends upon whether the loss claimed is a business loss of that nature.\nIn our opinion the amount which became payable by the respondent firm cannot be called its business loss.\nIn order to be deductible the loss must be in the nature of a commercial loss and, as has been said above, must spring directly out of it and must really be incidental to the business itself.\nIt is not sufficient that it falls on the trader in some 'other capacity or is merely connected with his business.\nCounsel for the respondent relied upon a judgment of this Court in Badridas Daga vs The Commissioner of Income tax (1).\nIn that case an agent of the assessee engaged for the purpose of carrying on of the assessee 's business had authority to operate a bank account.\nActing under such authority the agent withdrew from the bank monies and put them to his personal use.\nThe assessee was able to recover from the agent only a part of the amount misappropriated and the balance was written off as irrecoverable debt and it was held that it was not allowable under section 10(2)(xi) or 10(2)(xv) of the Act but it was a loss deductible in computing the profits under section 10(1) of the Act as a loss incidental to the carrying on of his business.\nCounsel relied on the following observation of Venkatarama Ayyar, J., at p. 695: \"The result is that when a claim is made for a deduction for which there is no specific provision in section 10(2), whether it is admissible or not will depend on whether having regard to accepted commercial practice and trading principles it can be said to arise out of the carrying on of the business and to be incidental to it.\n,, That passage has to be read in the circumstances of (1)[1959] S.C.R. 690.\n954 that case where the employment of agents was incidental to the carrying on of the business and it was observed that it logically followed that the losses which were incidental to such employment were also incidental to the carrying on of the business.\nAt page 696, it was observed: \"At the same time it should be emphasised that the loss for which a deduction could be made under section 10(1) must be one that springs directly from the carrying on of the business and is incidental to it and not any loss sustained by the assessee, even if it has some connection with his business.\" Reference may also be made to an English decision in Curtis vs J. & G. Oldfield Ltd. (1).\nIn that case the managing director of a company of wine and spirit merchants embezzled monies of the ' company and that.\nwas claimed as a loss as a bad debt and it was held that it was not a trading loss and was therefore not an admissible deduction.\nIn that case the contention of the Crown *as that the sum was not an ordinary trading debt and therefore could not be a bad debt and that the loss was not connected with, and did not arise out of the trade.\nRowlatt, J., said at p. 330: \"When the Rule speaks of a bad debt it means a debt which is a debt that would have come into the balance sheet as a trading debt in the trade that is in question and that it is bad.\nIt does not really mean any bad debt which, when it was a good debt, would not have come in to swell the profit.\n\" In the present case the liability was imposed upon the respondent firm because it was treated as an agent within the meaning of section 42(1) of the Act and the liability was imposed because of the deeming provision in sub section\n(2) of section 42 of the Act.\ncan it be said, in the present case, that the liability imposed upon the respondent firm was a business debt arising out of the business of the respondent or to use the words of Venkatarama Ayyar, J., \"springs directly from the carrying on of the business and is incidental to it or is a trading debt in the business of the respondent firm.\n\" As we have said above, that condition has not (1)(1925) 955 been fulfilled and the loss which the respondent has incurred is not in its own business but the liability arose because of the business of another person and that is not a permissible deduction within section 10(1) of the Act.\nIt is not a loss which has to be deducted in respect of the business of the respondent from the profits and gains of the respondent 's business.\nCounsel for the respondent also relied on Lord 's Dairy Farm Ltd. vs Commissioner of Income tax, Bombay(1).\nThat 'was a case of embezzlement by an employee and it was held that the loss directly arose from the necessity of employing cashiers and therefore the loss by embezzlement was a trading loss but in that very case it was held that before a claim could be made for deduction of a debt as bad debt it must be a debt in law.\nThat case is not applicable to the facts of the present case and is of little assistance in the decision of the question before us.\nCounsel for the respondent next relied on Calcutta Co., Ltd. vs The Commissioner of Income tax (2).\nIt was held in that case that the expression \"profits and gains\" has to be understood in its commercial sense and that there could be no computation of profits and gains until the expenditure necessary for earning those profits and gains is deducted therefrom and that when there is no specific provision in section 10(2) in regard to claim made, its allowability will depend on accepted commercial practice and trading principles and it will be allowed if it can be said to arise out of the carrying on of the business and is incidental to it.\nAs a principle it is unexceptionable but it does not carry the matter any further.\nIt was next contended that the matter falls within section 10(2)(xi) of the Act, i.e., it is in respect of the busi ness.\nThis contention has even less substance than the claim of deduction under section 10(1).\nUnder cl.\n(xi) also a debt is only allowable when it is a debt and arises out of and as an incident to the trade.\nExcept in money lending trade debts can only be so described (1) (2) [1959] 37 I.T.R. 956 if they are due from customers for goods supplied or loans toconstituents or transactions of a similar kind.\nIn every case the test is, was the debt due as an incident to the business; if it is not of that character it will be a capital loss.\nThus a loan advanced by a firm of Solicitors to a company in the formation of which it acted as legal adviser is not deductible on its becoming irrecoverable because that is not a part of the profession of a Solicitor: C. I. R. vs Hagart & Burn Murdoch (1).\nIn our opinion the High Court 'was in error in answering the question in favour of the respondent.\nWe therefore allow this appeal, set aside the judgment and order of the High Court and answer the question against the respondent.\nThe appellant will have his costs in this Court and in the High Court.\nAppeal allowed.\n",

No. 132 of 1960).\nNovember 19.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by SUBBA RAO, J.\nThese appeals filed by a certificate issued by the High Court of judicature at Madras raise a question of Hindu Law pertaining to marriage in 'Asura form '.\nThe material facts may be briefly stated : To appreciate the, facts and the contentions of the parties the 247 following genealogy may be usefully extracted Muthusami Naicker | | | Senior wife Junior wife | | Konda Bommu Naicker Kamayasami Naicker (died 23.10.1873) (died 31.\n7. 1901) | | | | Kandaswami Naicker Ponnuthayee Naicker (died 31.\n7. 1881) (died 13.3 1938) | Banmuga Valla | Konda Bommu Naicker | (died 21.1 1901) | | | | | | | Dorairaja Muthusami Kama Parama | alias (2nd Plff) yasami sivam Married | Thanipuli (3rd Plff)(4th Plff) Errammal | chami (died 2.2.1933) | (1st Plff) | | Bangru Ammual | (died 14.12.1930) | | | married also 8 other wise of whom the last to die were: (a) Meenakshi Ammual (died 5.6. 1938) (b) Krishna Ammual (died 10.11.1938) (c) Vellayammal alias Chinathayammal (died 2.5.\n1940).\n248 Thevaram is an ancient impartible zamindari in Madurai District.\nShanumugavalla Konda Bommu Naicker was zamindar from 23.8.1876 to 20.1.1901.\nOn his death on January 21, 1901 Bangaru Ammal, his daughter, got his entire estate under the will executed by him.\nTo discharge the debts incurred by her father Bangaru Ammal executed on March 13, 1913 a mortgage of her properties for a sum of Rs. 2,15,000/ in favour of one Chidambram Chettiar.\nOn his death his son Veerappa Chettiar filed on April 16, of 1925 against Bangaru Ammal in the Subordinate judge 's Court, Dindigul for the recovery of a sum of Rs. 5,49,6338 7 being the balance of the amount due under the said mortgage.\nThe suit was compromised and on July 28, 1928, a compromise decree was passed therein.\nUnder the compromise decree the mortgaged properties were divided into three Schedules A, B & C and it was provided that if a sum of Rs. 3,75,000/ was paid by July 31, 1931, the mortgage must be deemed to have been fully discharged but in default the properties in Schedule A of the decree were to become the absolute properties of the plaintiff.\nB Schedule properties i.e., some of the pannai lands and the C Schedule properties, i.e., those already alienated by Bangaru Ammal were released from the mortgage.\nOne K. V. Ramasami Iyer, the Manager of the estate was appointed Receiver of the A Schedule properties and he was directed to deposit the surplus income into court towards the payment of the amount due under the compromise decree.\nBefore the expiry of the period prescribed under the said decree Bangaru Ammal died on December 14, 1930, and her mother Errammal claiming to be her heir on the ground that Bangaru Ammal 's marriage was held in 'Asura form ' filed I.A. No. 190 of 1931 in the court of the Subordinate judge, Dindigul, for directing the Receiver to hand over the estate to her.\nVeerappa Chettiar in his turn filed I.A.No.170 of 1932 for 249 directing the Receiver to deliver possession of A Schedule properties on the ground that the term prescribed under the compromise decree had expired and the balance of the amount due under the decree was not paid to him.\nIn the petition filed by Errammal she raised the question of the validity and the binding nature of the compromise decree on her.\nAfter elaborate inquiry on February 1, 1933, the learned Subordinate judge, though he held that the marriage of Bangaru Ammal was in 'Asura form ', dismissed her petition for the reason that the mortgage was valid and binding on her and allowed the petition filed by Veerappa Chettiar directing the delivery of the possession of A Schedule properties to him.\nOn February 2, 1933, Veerappa Chettiar had taken delivery of A Schedule properties and on July 19, 1933 he was registered as proprietor of Thevaram estate by the Collector of Madura.\nOn February 2, 1933, Errammal died executing a will dated January 30, 1933, in favour of her nephew Thangachami Naicker.\nIt may also be mentioned that three of the co widows of Shanmugavalla survived Errammal.\nThey died one after another and the last of them Vellayammal passed away on May 2, 1940.\nThangachami Naicker along with one of the widows filed appeals to the High Court against the said judgments but those appeals were dismissed by the High Court on the ground that they were not maintainable.\nAs Thangachami Naicker interfered with the right of Veerappa Chettiar with regard to certain tanks and water courses in Zamindari he filed 0.\nsection 2 of 1934 in the Subordinate judge 's court of Dindigul against Thanchami Naicker and obtained a decree declaring his right to the said tanks.\nThe appeal filed by Thanchami Naicker against that decree was also dismissed with costs on April 10, 1940.\nIn execu tion of the decree for costs Veerappa Chettiar got the property alleged to be in possession of Thanchami 250 Naicker attached.\nOne section Michael (son of Thanchami Naicker) objected to the attachment of the said property on the basis of a sale in his favour by the alleged reversioners to the estate of Bangaru Ammal.\nThat petition was dismissed on August 23, 1944.\nThe said claimant section Michael filed 0.\nsection No. 52 of 1944 in the court of the Subordinate judge, Dindigul for setting aside the said claim order.\nTo that suit Veerappa Chettiar and Thangachami Naicker were made party defendants.\nOn January 31, 1945 the alleged reversioners to the estate of Bangaru Ammal filed 0.\nsection 14 of 1,945 in the Court of the Subordinate judge, Dindigul against Veerappa Chettiar, his younger brother and defendants 3 & 9 who were alleged to be the tenants in possession of some of the items of the plaint Schedule properties.\nThe plaintiffs in that suit are the grandsons of one Kandaswamy Naicker shown in the genealogy a paternal uncle of Shanmugavalla Konda Bommu Naicker.\nThey claimed that they are the reversioners to the estate of Bangaru Ammal on the ground that Bangaru Ammal was married in 'Asura form '.\nIt is alleged in the plaint that succession opened in their favour when Vellayammal died on May 2, 1940 and that the compromise decree passed against Bangaru Ammal was not binding on them and that in any view the property set out in Schedule C and C 1 attached to the plaint did not pass to Veerappa Chettiar under the said decree.\nThe contesting defendants in both the suits pleaded that the marriage of Bangaru Ammal was not in 'Asura form ', and therefore the plaintiffs in 0.\nsection 52 of 1944 were not the reversioners to the estate of Bangaru Ammal, that the compromise decree was binding on the estate and that C and C 1 Schedule properties also passed to the decree holder thereunder and that in any view the suit was barred by time.\n251 It is seen from the foregoing narration of facts that the same questions of fact and law arise in both the suits for the title of the plaintiffs in 0.\nsection No. 52 of 1944 was derived under a sale deed from the plaintiffs ' in 0.\nsection No. 14 of 1945.\nTherefore the plaintiffs ' claim in the former suit will stand or fall on the plaintiffs ' title in the latter suit.\nFor that reason both the suits were heard together by the Subordinate judge and appeals arising from his common judgment by the High Court.\nThe learned Subordinate judge held on the evidence that the marriage of Bangaru Ammal with the Mannarkottai zamindar was in Asura form as Mannarkottai zamindar had spent Rs. 300/ to Rs. 575 for Bangaru Ammal 's marriage and that circumstance was in view of certain decisions of the High Court would make it an Asura marriage.\nHe further held that the aforesaid compromise decree was binding on the plaintiffs.\nAs regards C and C. 1 Schedule properties lie held that they had passed to Veerappa Chettiar under the compromise decree as part of the Thevaram Zamindari and that the plaintiffs were not in possession within 12 years of the suit in regard to item 70 of the C Schedule.\nOn those findings he dismissed O.S. No. 14 of 1945 with costs.\nIn O.S. 52 of 1944 he held that the plaintiff therein acquired a valid title as he purchased the land in dispute therein from the plaintiffs in the other suit who are the reversioners to the estate of Bangaru Ammal and that the decree in execution of which the said property was attached was not binding on the estate of said Bangaru Ammal.\nIn that view he decreed the said suit.\nAs against the decree passed in O.S. 52 of 1944, Veerappa Chettiar filed an appeal in the High Court of Madras being A.S. No. 816 of 1947.\nAs against decree in O.S. 14 of 1945 dismissing the 252 plaintiffs ' suit they filed an appeal to the High Court being A.S. 83 of 1948.\nVeerappa Chettiar filed cross objections therein.\nBoth the appeals were heard together by the High Court.\nThe High Court held that in Bangaru Ammal 's marriage the practice of giving Kambu or flour or what is called the taking of Mappetti (millet flour box) before the betrothal was followed and that the marriage expenses were entirely borne by the Mannarcottai Zamindar presumably in pursuance of the practice existing in the community or in pursuance of an arrangement between the parties and therefore the marriage was Asura.\nThe High Court further held that under the compromise decree only Melwaram right in C and C. 1 Schedule properties passed to Veerappa Chettiar but as there was no clear evidence as to who was in actual possession of the said lands and as the persons in actual occupation of the land were not impleaded in the suit, it was necessary in the interest of the parties to reserve the right of the plaintiffs to recover possession of C and C. I Schedule lands in an appropriate proceedings instituted for the purpose.\nIn regard to item No. 70 of C. Schedule land the High Court agreed with the finding of the Subordinate judge.\nThe High Court also negatived the plea of limitation, with the result A.S. No. 816 of 1947 was dismissed with costs and A.S. No. 83 of 1948 subject to the said modification was dismissed with costs.\nHence the appeals.\nBoth the appeals were heard together as they raised common points.\nThe arguments of Mr. A.V. Viswanatha Sastri, the counsel for the appellant, may be summarised thus : The marriage of Bangaru Ammal with a Mannarcottai Zamindar was not held in Asura form and therefore the plaintiffs in O.S. 52 of 1944 being her father 's uncle 's grand children were not reversioners to her estate.\nAccording to Hindu Dharamshastras the main distinction between Brahma, and Asura form of marriages is that while in the 253 former there is a gift of the bride, in the latter there is a sale of the bride.\nExcept a bare allegation in the plaints that the said marriage was held in Asura form the plaintiffs did not give any particulars or set tip any custom in the community to which the parties to the marriage belonged.\nThey have adduced evidence to the effect that a sum of Rs. 1,000/ was paid as parisam by the Mannarcottai Zamindar to the bride 's father for taking the bride but both the courts having rightly held that the said payment was not established by the evidence erred in making out a case of a different consideration for the marriage.\nThe first court held wrongly that the fact that Mannarcottai Zamindar spent Rs. 300/ to Rs. 575/for the marriage expenses would make it an asura marriage while the High Court went further and erroneously held that there was a general custom in the community to pay the bride 's price by way of giving Kambu grain and Kambu flour at the time of the settlement of marriage and that for the bridegroom 's party to bear the expenditure for celebrating the marriage and that in the case of Bangaru Ammal 's marriage the said Kambu was given and that the expenditure for the marriage was incurred by the Mannarcottai Zamindar presumably in pursuance of the practice existing in the community or in pursuance of an arrangement between the parties.\nApart from the fact that no such custom was pleaded, there was no evidence to sustain the said custom.\nThat apart the mere giving of Kambu as a ceremonial relic of the past or the bearing of the expenditure on the marriage wholly or partly by the bridegroom 's party could not be a bride 's price as contemplated by the Sastras, for the bride 's father in those events could not be said to have received any price for the bride.\nIn short the learned counsel attacks both the legal and the factual findings arrived at by the High Court.\nThe gist of the learned counsel for the Mr. Bheemasankaran 's contention may 254 be briefly stated thus: According to Dharam Shastras there were eight forms of marriage in Hindu Law, four approved and four unapproved.\nBut as centuries rolled by most of them became obsolete and at present there are only two forms of marriage, Brahmu and Asura.\nWhatever may have been their comparative merits in the bygone days, they have now come to be recognized as two valid 1, forms of marriage that can be followed without any sense of inferiority by all the castes.\nThough in remote antiquity the Asura form of marriage night have involved a real sale transaction, at present it would be enough to constitute such a marriage if a ritual form was observed indicating the consciousness of the community or the parties contracting the marriage that it was an Asura marriage.\nThis consciousness may be indicated by the ceremonial giving of Kambu at the time of betrothal or by the bridegroom 's party meeting the expenses wholly or substantially of the marriage.\nThai apart in the present case there is clear evidence that the practice in the community to which Bangaru Ammal and her husband belonged that Kambu is given by the bridegroom 's party to the bride 's party at the time of betrothal and the bridegroom 's party bears the expenditure of the marriage which clearly indicate that the bride 's father or in his absence by the bride 's relatives entitled to give her away in marriage get a clear benefit for giving the bride, and further there is evidence that the said practice was followed in the case of Bangaru Ammal 's marriage.\nWhat is more to constitute a Brahmu marriage there should be a 'Kanyadhan ' but in this case it has been found that there was no 'Kanyadhan ' and therefore if the marriage of Bangaru Ammal could not have been in 'Brahma form ' it could have been only in the alternative form, namely Asura form.\nBefore we advert to the arguments advanced we would like to make some general observations.\n255 We are not concerned here with the relatives importance of the said two forms of marriages at the present day but only with the conditions laid down by Shastras for the said two forms of marriage and with a question as to which form was adopted in Bangaru Ammal 's marriage.\nNor are we concerned with a question whether the institution of marriage in Brahmu form is now maintained in its original purity.\nWe are also in these appeals not concerned with any customary form of marriage but only with a marriage sanctioned by Hindu Law, for no custom was pleaded in derogation of Hindu Law.\nBut there may be a custom in a community not in derogation of the Hindu Law but in regard to the manner of complying with a condition laid down by Hindu Law.\nthat is to say if the criterion for an Asura marriage was that there should be a sale of the bride, there may be a custom in a community in regard to the manner of paying the consideration ' for the sale.\nIt may be mentioned that in this case the learned counsel for the respondents does not rely upon any custom even in the later sense but only on the practice obtaining in the community in support of the evidence that the said practice was followed in Bangaru Ammal 's marriage.\nThe main question therefore is what are the ingredients of an Asura form of marriage.\nAs the Manu Samhita has always been treated by sages and commentators from the earliest time as being of a paramount authority, let us look to it for guidance.\nThe following verses from Manu Samhita as translated by Manmatha Nath Dutt Shastri read as follows: CHAPTER III, Verse 21: They (different types of marriages) are known as the Brahma, Daiva A 'raha, Prajapatya, A 'sura, Gandharva, Rakshasa and Paisacha, which forms the eighth.\n256 Verse 24: The four forms of marriage the seers have ordained as proper for Brahmanas : only the Rakshasa form as proper for Kshatriyas, and the A 'sura form as proper for Vais 'yas and S 'udras.\nVerse 25: Thus out of these five forms of marriage, three are lawful, and two are sinful (unlawful).\nLet a man never marry a wife either in the Pisacha or in the A 'sura form since these two forms are prohibited.\nVerse 27: The form (of marriage) in which well attired bride, decorated with ornaments, is given in marriage to an erudite, good charactered bridegroom especially invited by the bride 's father himself to receive her, is called Brahma.\nVerse 31: The form, in which the bridegroom, on paying money to her father and to herself, out of the promptings, of his own desire, receives the bride in marriage, is called A 'sura.\nVerse 51 : An erudite father of a girl shall not take anything by way of Sulka from her bridegroom.\nBy taking a dowry out of greed, he becomes the seller of his off spring.\nVerse 53: Even the acceptance of abovine pair (by the father of the bride from the bridegroom) is designated as a dowry by certain authorities, (the acceptance of) 257 a dowry be it costly, or be it of insignificant value, constitutes the sale of the girl.\nVerse 54 : A marriage in which the bride 's relations do accept the dowry (voluntarily presented by the bridegroom 's father, etc.) is no sale (of the bride), since such a present is but an adoration of the bride done out of love or affection.\nVerse 98 (of Chapter IX) Even a S 'udra must not take any price it.\nduty or pecuniary consideration) for the hands of his daughter when giving her away in marriage.\nSuch acceptance of money constitutes a sale of the girl in disguise.\nThe gist of the verses is that before Manu Smriti came into existence the A 'sura form was considered to be proper for Vaishs and Sudras but it was prohibited for the Brahmins and Kashatriyas.\nBut Manu was emphatic that the said form of marriage was sinful for all castes including the Shudras.\nThere is no ambiguity in the verses in regard to the general prohibition to all castes ' for Verse No. 98 emphasizes that even a S 'udra must not take any price for the hand of his daughter when giving away in marriage.\nThe next question is what is the criterion of an A 'sura marriage according to Manu.\nA contrast between the terminology in the definition of Brahma marriage and that of A 'sura marriage brings out clearly his intention.\nThe following words stand out in the definitions.\nThey are 'dana ' (giving) 'Kanyapradanam ' (the taking of the bride), \"Dravina ' (wealth), 'dattava ' (after having given), 'Saktitah ' (as much as he can), 'Svacchandya ' (as according to his will).\nThe word 'Apradana ' is used in the 258 definition of A 'sura marriage in contradistinction to the word 'dana ' in Brahmu form of marriage, while a, in the Brahmu form of marriage the father makes a gift of the bride, in the A 'sura form the bridegroom takes the bride otherwise than by a gift.\nIn the former the father gives the bride decorated with ornaments, while in the latter the bridegroom takes the bride after giving wealth to the father of the bride and the bride.\nWhile in the former the father voluntarily gives the bride in the latter the bridegroom out of his own will pays as much money as he can to the father and takes his bride.\nThe words Saktitah ' and 'Svacchandya ' imply that the payment is made because the bridegroom can and the girl is taken because he wills that is to say a bridegroom who seeks the hand of a bride takes her as he can afford to buy her from her father.\nThe transaction is equated to that of a sale, for all the ingredients of sale were present.\nIf there is any ambiguity that is dispelled by Verse 51 and Verse 54.\nIn Verse 51 Manu makes it clear that by taking a dowry out of greed the father becomes the seller of his off spring. 'Sulka ' means the taking of a gratuity or price.\nThe expression 'dravina ' in Verse 31 is clarified by the use of the word 'Sulka ' in Verse 51.\nWhat is prohibited is Sulka or the price for the bride.\nVerse 54 brings out the distinction between 'Sulka ' or 'dravina ' paid by the bridegroom as a price for the bride and the dowry given for the bride as a present out of love or affection or in adoration of the bride.\nVerse 98 further empbasizes that what Manu prohibits is the sale of a bride for price.\nA 'sura marriage, according to Manu, is a transaction of sale in which the girl is sold for a price.\nPractically the same meaning though expressed in different phraseology is given by other Hindu Law givers.\nThe following translations given by Max Muller in the \"Sacred Books of the East ', of 259 the various sages may now be extracted Baudhayana text 1, II, 20 (7) '(If the bridegroom receives a maiden) after gladdening (the parents) by money (that is) the rite of the Asuras (asura). ' Verse 2 : 'Now they quote also (the following verses) It is declared that a female who has been purchased for money is not a wife.\nShe cannot (assist) as sacrifices offered to the Gods or the manes.\nKasyapa has stated that she is a slave. ' Baudhayana Prasad Adhyaya 11, Kandika 21 Verse 3 : 'Those wicked men who, seduced by agreed, give away a daughter for a fee, who (thus) fall (after death) into a dreadful place of punishment and destroy their family down to the seventh (generation).\nMoreover they will repeatedly die and be born again.\nAll (this) is declared (to happen), if a fee (is taken ).\n, Vasishtha Chapter I Verse 35. 'If, after making a bargain (with the father, a suitor) marries (a damsel) purchased for money, that (is called) the Manusha rite. ' Narada Chapter XII Ver8e 42.\nWhen a price is (asked for the bride by the father and) taken (by him), it is the form termed Asura. 'Gautama, 'Chapter IV Verse 11.\nThe form of marriage in which a bride is purchased for money, is called the A 'suram. ' 260 Vishnu Chapter XXIV Verse 24.\nIf the damsel is sold (to the bridegroom), it is called an Asura marriage. 'Yagngavalkya ' : 'The asura by largely giving of money ; the Gandharva by mutual consent; the Rakshasa by forcible taking by waging war and Paisacha by deceiving the girl ' Translation of Srisachandra Vidyaamava : 1918 Edition page 126 : In the Mitakshara the said text is commented upon thus : .lm15 \" The Asura marriage is that in which money is largely given (to the father and others in exchange for the girl).\n'Apastamba ':\"If the suitor pays money (for his bride) and marries her (afterwards) that (marriage is called) the Asura rite. ' 'Kautilya ': Arthasastra: Sulkadanat Asura ' the word used is \"Sulka\" Medhatithi, in his commentary on Verse 54 of Manu Samhita points out that the receipt of money or money 's worth for the benefit of the girl (Kanyarthe) does not amount to her sale, and is desirable as it tends to enhance her self esteem and also raises her in the estimation of others, and concludes with the observation that receipt of a dowry for the girl (kanyartham danagrahanam) is prescribed by thus stating the good arising from it (arthavadena) : Vide at 772.\nApte 's Dictionary : page 239 : Col. III.\nAsura is explained thus : 'One of the eight forms of marriage in which the bridegroom purchase ; the bride from her father or other paternal kinsmen ' Manu 331 and Yagnayavalkya 1.61 are cited 261 The said sages and commentators accepted the view expressed by Manu and in effect described A 'sura marriage as the transaction where a bridegroom purchases a girl for a price paid to the father of the girl or to kinsmen who are en titled to give her in marriage.\nThe distinction between the bride 's price and the presents to the bride is also recognized.\nThe learned judges of the High Court relying upon the text of Apasthamba observed that 'the payment to the bride 's father is for the purpose of complying with Dharma and not as a consideration for an commercial transaction.\nThe interpretation may explain away on Dharmic principles the sordid nature of the transaction, but does not detract from its essential incidents.\nWe, therefore, hold that A 'sura marriage is nothing more than a transaction of marriage whereunder a bridegroom takes a bride for the price paid by him to the bride 's father or others entitled to give her and therefore in substance it is a sale of the bride.\nIt is said that the incurring of the expenditure of the marriage by the bridegroom is also a consideration for giving the bride.\nIn this context reliance is placed on the Law and Custom of Hindu Castes by Arthur Steel.\nThis book was written in 1868.\nThe author appears to have collected the laws and customs obtaining in the Presidency of Bombay, and had compiled them for the purpose of convenience of reference.\nAt page 24 the author says: 'There are eight kinds of marriages recognized in the Sastras : 1, Brahm, where the charges are incurred solely by the girl 's father; x x x x x 5, Usoor, where she is taken in exchange for wealth, and married; this species is peculiar in the Wys and Soodra castes, B.S.(Mit), See Munoo, 3.20,34.\nIt is considered as Uscorwiwuha, and stree soolk, and the money, if unpaid, is an unlawful debt, B 2, 199.\nThe definition of Asura by the author does not carry the matter further, for it is consistent with that 262 given in the Hindu law Texts but what is relied upon is his definition of Brahmu marriage as one where charges are incurred solely by the girl 's father.\nFrom the said definition a converse proposition is sought to be drawn viz : that marriage would be Asura marriage if the charges were incurred mainly by the bridegroom 's father.\nFirstly the definition of Brahmu marriage by the learned Author does not conform with the definition of the said marriage by the lawgivers.\nSecondly it does not follow from the passage that if the bridegroom 's father incurs the expenditure the marriage is an Asura marriage.\nIf that be so, the author would have stated in his definition of Asura marriage that such incurring of the expenditure would make a marriage an Asura marriage.\nThis valuable compilation of the laws and customs of the day does not throw any light on the question now raised before us.\nLet us now see whether there is any merit in the contention that the concept of sale for a price has by progress of time lost its content and that at the present time a mere form of sale irrespective of a real benefit to the bride 's father would meet the requirements of an Asura , marriage.\nNo text or commentary taking that view has been cited to us.\nIndeed the case law on the subject does not countenance any such subsequent development.\nThe earliest decision on the subject cited to us is that ofthe Divisional Bench of the Bombay High Court \"Jaikisondas Gopaldas vs Harkisondas Hulleshandas '.Green j, defines the Asura marriage at page 13 'The essential characteristic of the Asura form ofmarriage appears to be the giving of money or presents by the bridegroom or his family to the father or parental kinsmen of the bride,, or, in tact, a sale of the girl by her father or other relation having the disposal of her in marriage in (1) Bom.\n9. 263 consideration of money or money 's worth paid to them by the intended husband or his family.

Reports 244.\n(2) (3) Bom.\n264 money consideration for it, the substance of the transaction makes it, according to Hindu Law, not a gift but a sale of the girl.\nThe money received is what is called bride price; and that is the essential element of the Asura form.\nThe fact that the rites prescribed for the Brahmu form are gone through cannot take it out of that category, if there was pecuniary benefit to the giver of the girl.\nThe Hindu law givers one and all condemn such benefit and the Shastras, regarding it as an ineradicable sin, prescribe no penance for the sale of a bride.\n\" The learned judge also accepted the presumption that every marriage under the Hindu Law is according to the Brahma form but it can be rebutted by evidence.\nIn 'section Authikesavulu Chetty vs section Ramanujan Chetty ' (1) at the betrothal ceremony a married woman of the caste to which the parties belonged proceeded from the bridegroom 's house to the house of the bride carrying certain presents consisting of cocoanuts, betel and nut, garlands, black beads, saffron red powder, etc.\nin a tray.\nThere was also a pagoda and a fanam in it.\nThere was also an arrangement at that time that the bridegroom 's father had to pay certain amount to the bride and the bride 's father had also to give some jewels to the bridegroom.\nIt was contended that the marriage was an Asura marriage.\nThe learned judges said that the distinctive mark of the Asura marriage was the payment of money for the bride, and that the payment of a pagoda and 2 1/2 annas could not have been intended to be the consideration for the bride where the bride 's father spent thousands of rupees himself and gave presents of considerable value to the bride and the bridegroom.\nThis decision, therefore, emphasises that mere payment of small amounts as a compliment to one of the parents cannot be treated as a consideration for the sale of the bride.\nIt also lays down that all the circumstances of the case will have to be looked into to ascertain whether any amount was paid as price for the bride.\n(1) Mad.\n265 A Divisional Bench of the Madras High Court in 'Gabrielnathaswmi vs Valliammai Ammal ' (1) negatived the contention that the mere fact that a bride 's parents received what is known as 'parisam ' it would lead to the conclusion that the marriage of the girl took place in Asura form and not in Brahma form.\nThe learned judges observed: \"It may be that parisum is a relic of what in old days was regarded as the price for the bride.\nx x x x The real test is whether in the community or among the parties the payment of 'parisam ' was tacitly understood as being substantially a payment for taking the girl in marriage.\nThat will depend generally upon the evidence in the case.\n\" They also reaffirmed the presumption under Hindu Law in; the following words : 'Ordinarily the presumption is that whatever may be the caste to which the parties belong, a marriage should be regarded as being in the Brahma form unless it can be shown that it was in the Asura form '.\nThis decision deals with 'parisam ' with which we are also concerned in these appeals.\nThis is an authority for the proposition that the use of the word 'parisam ' is not decisive of the question that it is a bride 's price, but that it must be established in each case whether the payment small or large, in cash or kind, is made as a bride 's price i. c. as consideration for the bride.\nIn \"Ratnathanni vs Somasundara Mudaliar\" (2) a sum of Rs. 200/ was paid to the bride 's mother for the expenses of the marriage as a term of the contract of the marriage.\nOn that finding Ramesam. ' J. concluded that the payment was made for the benefit of the bride 's mother as in the absence of the payment, she would have had to find the amount in some other way, by borrowing or pledging her jewels or other properties and therefore the marriage was in Asura form.\nThe learned judge relied upon Steel 's observation that the parents should incur the expenditure of the marriage in the Brahma form and presumably (1) A.I.R. 1920 Mad. 884.\n(2) 266 drew a contrary inference that if the bridegroom 's party met the expenditure it would be an Asura marriage.\nThe learned judge also relied upon that decision in 'Muthu Aiyar vs Chidambara Aiyar '(1).\nSpencer, J. in a separate judgement agreed with him.\nAs we have pointed out we do not see any justification in the Hindu Law texts in support of the view that the bearing of the expenditure of the marriage by the bridegroom is a test of an Asura marriage.\nThe fact that the expenditure of the marriage is borne by bridegroom 's party cannot in any sense of the term be a consideration given to the father for taking the bride.\nRamesam J. sitting singly in 'Samu Asari vs Anachi Ammal ' (2) restated his view in a more emphatic form.\nHe observed: 'It seems to me immaterial whether it is the whole of the expenses of the marriage or a substantial portion of it.\nTo the extent the bride 's father gets contribution of that kind from the bridegroom 's father, he benefits by it; though he does not pocket it, but he spends for the marriage. .\nAt the same time the learned judge observed that under certain circumstances payments made to the bride 's parents which are either small or relatively small having regard to the scale in which the expenses of the marriage are incurred do not make a marriage an Asura marriage.\nThis decision therefore makes a distinction between courtesy presents given to the bride 's parents and whole or substantial portion of the expenditure incurred by the bridegroom 's father.\nWhile we agree that courtesy presents to the bride 's parents cannot by themselves conceivably make a marriage an Asura one, we find it difficult to hold that the incurring of expenditure by a bridegroom satisfies the test of consideration for the bride.\nIn 'Kailasanatha Mudaliar vs Parasakthi Vadivanni ', (3) Varadachar J., speaking for the (1) (2) (3) Mad.\n267 Court lays down the test of the Asura marriage in the following manner : \"The distinctive feature of the Asura form of marriage is the giving of money or money 's worth to the bride 's father for his benefit or as consideration for his giving the girl in marriage.\n\" The learned judge distinguishes the case of \"Samu Asari vs Anachi Ammal ' (1) on the ground that there money was held to have been paid for the father 's benefit though utilized by him to meet the expense of the marriage which he must have defrayed out of his own fund and points out also the distinction between payment to the father for his own benefit and payments to the bride received by kinsmen not for their own use.\nIn that case a jewel was presented by the bride 's father and placed on the bride 's neck at the time of the betrothal ceremony as ' parisam ' and the value of the jewel was not even the subject of a bargain but merely left to the pleasure of the bridegroom 's father.\nThe learned judge observed that such a gift could in no sense be called bride 's price.\nIn 'Sivangalingam Pillai vs K. V. Ambalavana Pillai, (2) the bride 's father gave a large amount and also jewels to the bride and plaintiff 's brother in law on behalf of the bridegroom gave the bride 's father a present of Rs. 1,000/ and a cloth worth Rs. 65/ .\nIt was also agreed that all the expenses of the marriage should be borne by the bridegroom.\nIt was contended that the said presents and the incurring of expenditure on the marriage was a consideration for the bride and therefore the marriage was in an Asura form.\nThe Divisional Bench rejected the contention.\nPandrang Row J. observed at page 481: \"It is a well known fact that, whatever the custom is, the bridegroom and his people also spend a considerable sum of money in respect of the marriage whenever they can afford it.\nSuch expenditure obviously does not convert the marriage which is otherwise in the Brahma form into one which is in (1) (2) A.I.R. 1938.\n479. 268 the Asura form.\n\" The learned judge proceeded to state at page 480 thus : \"So far as our Presidency is concerned, all marriages among Hindus are presumed to be in the Brahma form unless it is proved that they were in the Asura form; in other words, it is incumbent on the party who alleges that a particular marriage was in the Asura form to prove that bride price was paid in respect of the marriage by the bridegroom or his people to the bride 's father\" and the present given to the bride 's father the learned judge remarked that this customary present would not necessarily amount to payment of bride 's price.\nAbdur Rahman J., added that 'if a party wishes to assert that the marriage was Asuric in form, he must establish that some price was paid for the bride in pursuance of either of an express or implied contract to the bride 's father or on his account.\n\" This judgment we may say so with respect puts the principle on a correct legal basis and brings out in bold relief the distinction between bird 's price on the one hand and the presents and the expenditure incurred in respect of the marriage by one or the other of the parties on the other hand Patanjali Sastri J., in 'V.S. Velavutha Pandaram vs section Suryamurthi Pillai ' (1) approached the case if we may say so from a correct perspective.\nThere a sum of Rs.500/ was paid by the bridegroom to the bride 's father for the specific purpose of making jewels for the bride in pursuance of a stipulation for such gift as a condition of giving the girl in marriage.\nThe learned, judge held that the said payment was not bride 's price and did not make the marriage an Asura marriage.\nThe learned judge in passing referred to the case of 'Samu Asari vs Anachi Ammal ' (2), and observed as follows : \" 'As the father was benefitted by such contribution in that he was relieved to that extent from defraying such expenses (1) (2) 269 himself, the marriage was one in the Asura form.\nThis view has been criticised in the latest edition of Mayne 's Hindu Law as not really warranted by the Hindu Law texts, and the point may have to be reconsidered when it arises.\n\" Patanjali Sastri, J., again considered this point in Second Appeal No. 2272 of 1945.\nThere on the occasion of the marriage one sovereign was given along with the other presents to the bride 's father as Memmekkanoni.\nThe question was whether the mere adoption of this customary form per se brought the marriage within the category of an Asura or unapproved marriage.\nThe learned judge expressed the view that the payment of memekanom no longer signifies in substance and in truth consideration for the transfer of the girl but has survived as a token ceremonial payment forming part of the marriage ritual.\nThe said judgment was confirmed by a Divisional Bench of the said High Court in 'Vedakummpprath Pillai Muthu appellant vs Kulathinkai Kuppan '.\n(1) Balakrishna Ayyar, J., speaking for the Bench neatly summarised the law on the subject at page 804 thus : \"One essential feature of an Asura marriage, the feature which makes the form objectionable, is that the father of the bride receives a gratuity or fee for giving the girl in marriage.\nOrdinarily, it would be expected of every decent and respectable father when he selects a husband for his daughter to make his selection uninfluenced by any considerations other than the welfare of the girl.\nBut when he receives a payment for his personal benefit, a very objectionable factor would influence his selection and it is clearly this which the ancient lawgivers took objection to and therefore relegated the form to the category we call 'disapproved '.\nWhen the father accepts money and allows his greed or avarice to sway his judgment, he thereby converts what is intended to be a sacrament into a commercial transaction.\n\" With respect we are in full agreement with the observations of the learned judge.\nCommenting upon the (1) 270 argument built upon the payment of one sovereign to the bride 's father the learned judge observed : \"In most, though not necessarily in all cases, the payment has lost all its original significance and survives only as a ritualistic form '; it has become a ceremonial symbol devoid of any content or meaning or purpose.\nx x x x Now when a father gives such a large amount as stridhanam and receives one sovereign in compliance with traditional form it would be very wrong to say that he had been selling or mortgaging the girl and that he received the sovereign from greed or love of gain.\n\" The foregoing discussion leads to the following results .\nUnder Hindu Law marriage is a sacrament and it is the religious duty of the father to give his daughter in marriage to a suitable person but if he receives a payment in cash or in kind as a consideration for giving his daughter in marriage he would be converting a sacrament into a commercial transaction.\nBrahma marriage satisfies the said test laid down by Hindu Law.\nBut from Vedic times seven other forms of marriage were recognized based on custom and convenience.\nAsura form is one of the eight forms of marriage.\nThe essence of the said marriage is the sale of a bride for a price and it is one of the unapproved forms of marriage prohibited by Manu for all the four castes of Hindu society.\nThe vice of the said marriage lies in the receipt of the price by the bride 's father or other persons entitled to give away the bride as a consideration for the bride.\nIf the amount paid or the ornaments given is not the consideration for taking the bride but only given to the bride or even to the bride 's father out of affection or in token of respect to them or to comply with a traditional or ritualistic form, such payment does not make the marriage an A 'sura marriage.\nThere is also nothing in the texts to indicate that the bearing 271 of the expenditure wholly or in part by the, bridegroom or his parents is a condition or a criterion of such a marriage, for in such a case the bride 's father or others entitled to give her in marriage do not take any consideration for the marriage, or any way benefit thereunder.\nThe fact that the 'bridegroom 's party bears the expenditure may be due to varied circumstances.\nPrestige, vanity, social custom, the poverty or the disinclination of the bride 's father or some of them may be the reasons for the incurring of expenditure by bridegroom 's father on the marriage but the money so spent is not the price or consideration for the bride.\nEven in a case where the bride 's father though rich is disinclined to spend a large amount on the marriage functions and allows the bridegroom to incur the whole or part of it, it cannot be said that he has received any consideration or price for the bride.\nThough in such a case if the bridegroom 's father had not incurred the said expenditure in whole or in part, the bride 's father might have to spend some money, on that account such as indirect result could not be described as price or consideration for giving the bride.\nShortly stated Asura marriage is a marriage where the bride 's father or any other person entitled to give away the bride takes Sulka or price for giving the bride in marriage.\nThe test is two fold: There shall not only be a benefit to the father, but that benefit shall form a consideration for the sale of the bride.\nWhen this element of consideration is absent, such a marriage cannot be described as Asura marriage.\nAs the Asura marriage does not comply with the strict standards of Hindu Law it is not only termed as an unapproved marriage, but it has been consistently held that whenever a question arises whether a marriage is a Brahmu or Asura, the presumption is that the marriage is in Brahma form and the burden is upon the person who asserts the con trary to prove that the marriage was either an Asura or any other form.\n272 With this background let us look at the facts of the case.\nThough in both the plaints it is stated that Bangaru Ammal had been married in Asura form, no particulars are given but in the evidence the plaintiff 's witnesses in one voice depose that the custom in the Rakambala caste to which Bangaru Ammal and her husband belonged, is to give money in the shape of 'parisam ' to the bride 's father at the time of the betrothal.\nThe witnesses who depose to Bangaru Ammal 's marrage say that at the time of her betrothal a sum of 1,000/ was paid as ' parisam '.\nBoth the Courts did not accept this evidence and they held that it had not been established that a sum of Rs. 1,000/ was paid as 'parisam ' at the time of the betrothal of Bangaru Ammal.\nThis finding is not attacked before us.\nIt is argued that the evidence discloses that there is a practice in the said caste to give Kambu as IT parisam ' to the bride 's father as a bride 's price and the said practice supports the evidence that in the case of the marriage of Bangaru Ammal also such a 'parisam ' was paid as consideration for the marriage.\nOn the question of the said alleged practice the evidence does not support it.\nP. W. I to P. W. 10 depose.\nthat \"parisam ' is paid in cash for marriages in their community varying from Rs. 150/ to Rs. 1,000/ .\nThis evidence has been rightly ' disbelieved by both the courts.\nThe evidence does not bear out the case of giving of 'parisam ' in Kambu.\nSome of the witnesses also depose to the payment of Rs. 1000/ as 'parisam ' at Bangaru Ammal 's marriage but that was not accepted by the courts.\nThe evidence destroys the case that 'parisam ' was paid at her marriage in Kambu.\nNo witness examined in the two cases says that Kambu is paid at the marriages of the members of the community or was paid at the time of Bangaru Ammal 's marriage as a consideration for the marriage but it is said that the witnesses who had been 273 examined in the earlier suit whose evidence has been marked by consent in the present case deposes to that fact.\nErrammal, the mother of Bangaru Ammal, whose evidence is marked as P. 11 (R) deposes that when Thevaram Zamindar married her the 'parisam ' was only Rs. 1,000/ and that when her daughter was married, the 'parisam ' was also Rs. 1000/ .\nIn cross examination she says that according to the custom of the community, it is the practice to bring a mapelli for the nischithartham (betrothal function) and it is customary also to bring cumbu and flour at the time of the marriage and sprinkle it in the marriage hall.\nThis evidence indicates that the 'parisam ' is only given in cash but Kambu is brought at the time of the marriage and sprinkled in the marriage hall presumably for the purpose of purification.\nThis evidence does not show that Kambu is given as \"parisam ' for taking the bride.\nSermalai Naicker who gave evidence in an earlier suit which is marked as P. 11 (a) belongs to Rajakambala caste.\nIn his chief examination he says that he paid Rs. 200/ as 'parisam ' at the time of the marriage and paid Rs. 300/ as \"parisam ' for the marriage of his son and received Rs. 200/ as 'parisam ' for the marriage of his daughter.\nIn cross examination he says that on the betrothal day only one kalam of cumbu and cash are given to the bride 's party and that the Kambu is used by the bride 's people and that at the time of the marriage 3 or 4 marakkals of cumbu are again brought which is thrown over the bride and the bridegroom byway of blessing.\nHe adds that throwing of the kambu is a ritual in marriage ceremonies and that Kambu and cash are called \"Parisam '.\nThis evidence brings out the distinction between cash paid as the 'Parisam ' and Kambu brought to conform with the traditional ritual.\n274 R.W. 3 in the earlier suit whose evidence is marked as D. 317 says that he was a guru of the Rajakambala caste and that he performed the marriage of Moolipatti zamindar.\nHe further says that Kambu is taken by the bridegroom 's party to the bride 's house when the betrothal takes place and that seven pieces of jaggery, a cloth etc. are also taken and that no money is given in the caste.\nWe do not see how this evidence supports the practice of paying kambu as 'parisam '.\nindeed his evidence shows that Kambu is taken only as a part of the ritual and he is definite that no 'parisam ' is paid in the caste.\nRamasami Naicker Zamindar of Ammaianaickoor.\nwas examined in the previous suit and his evidence is marked as D 416.\nHe is definite in the chief examination that no 'parisam ' is paid in his community.\nHe says that it is rather undignified to receive 'Parisam ' and that he has not seen any parisam paid in his caste.\nWhether this witness is speaking truth or not, his evidence does not support the plaintiff.\nFrom the aforesaid evidence it is not possible to hold that either there is a practice in the Rajakambala family to give Kambu as 'parisam ' for the bride or kambu was paid as 'parisam ' at the time of the betrothal ceremony in connection with Bangaru Ammal 's marriage.\nReliance is placed upon Nelson 's Manual of the Madhura Country published in 1.865.\nAt page 82 of Part II in that /Manual the following passage appears : \"After this, the price of the bride, which consists usually of 7 kalams of kambu grain, is solemnly carried under a canopy of white cloth towards the house of the bride 's father 275 its approach being heralded by music and dancing.\nThe procession is met by the friends of the bride who receive the price, and allege together to the bride 's house.\n\" Similarly, in Thurston 's Castes and Tribes of Southern India published in 1902 in Volume VII under the heading 'Thotti Naickers ' at page 192, the following passage is given \"The bride price is 7 kalams of Kambu and the couple may cat only this grain and horsegram until the wedding is over.\n\" The evidence adduced in this case does not support the said statement.\nEven if those formalities are observed, they are only the relics of the past.\nThat practice represents only a symbolic ritual which.\nhas no bearing upon the reality of the situation.\nIndeed the witnesses in the present case realizing the ritualistic character of the said observances seek to base the case of the Plaintiffs on a more solid foundation but have miserably failed in their attempt.\nThese passage s therefore do not help the plaintiffs.\nThe next question is whether the expenditure for the marriage was incurred by the bridegroom 's party i. e. by the Mannarcottai Zamindar.\nThe learned Subordinate judge held on the evidence that Thevaram Zamindar spent a large amount of money for the marriage but the Mannarcottai Zamindar also spent a sum of Rs. 300/ or Rs. 575/ for the marriage expenses.\nHe expressed the view that if the matter was res integra, he would have held that the incurring of such an expenditure by the bridegroom 's party would not have made the marriage.\nan Asura marriage but felt bound by some of the decisions 276 of the Madras High Court to come to the opposite conclusion.\nThe learned judges of the High Court came to the conclusion that the marriage expenses in their entirety were borne by the Mannarcottai Zamindar and it must have been either in pursuance of the custom or arrangement among the community.\nThe evidence as regards the custom of the bride groom 's party incurring the expenses of the marriage is unconvinc ing.\nIndeed the learned counsel for the respondent does not rely upon custom but he prefers to base his case on the finding of the High Court that the entire marriage expenditure was incurred by the Mannarcottai zamindar.\nLet us now consider the evidence in this regard in some detail.\nP.W. 1 says in his evidence that Bangaru Ammal was the only child of the Thevaram Zamindar, that he was very affectionate to her and that he spent heavily for the marriage though he was not able to say how much he spent.\nP. W. 4 also says that Thevaram Zamindar gave her lot of jewels and finally gave her his entire estate.\nThe evidence that Thevaram Zamindar spent large amounts on the marriage and gave lot of jewels to Bangaru Ammal must be true, for even in 1895 when the marriage of Bangaru Ammal took place it is inconceivable that the marriage would have been celebrated with a few hundred rupees that was given by the Mannarcottai zamindar.\nHe must have spent much larger amount than that consistent with his status and position in life and particularly when he was celebrating the marriage of his only daughter.\nNow coming to the documentary evidence in support of the contention that Mannarcottai Zamindar met the entire expenditure, the respondents relied upon P. , P. and P. is a letter dated August 8, 1885, written by persons representing the Mannarcottai zamindar to the 277 Thevaram Zamindar office.\nTherein he stated :\"You should soon get ready there all the materials and samans for the shed and 'Panthal ' in connection with muhurtham.\nWe will start and come without fail\".\nThis letter does not show that Mannarcottai Zamindar gave the money for the materials and samans for the said 'Panthal '.\nIt was only an intima tion that everything should be made ready for the marriage as Mannarcottai people would be coming there without fail.\nExhibit P. 23 is the account of expenditure incurred on Bangammal 's marriage from 1.9.1895 to 5.9.1895.\nIt is said that it represents the amount spent on behalf of Mannarcottai zamindar and the amount recouped from him.\nThe document is not very clear.\nThe account does not appear to represent the entire expenditure incurred at the time of marriage because the entry about charges for pounding 50 kalams of paddy shows that 50 kalams of paddy must have been supplied from Thevaram stores and there is nothing on the account to show that 50 kalams were purchased on Mannarcottai account.\nBe that as it may this account only shows that Mannarcottai zamindar paid about Rs. 300/ but the learned counsel for the respondents argued relying upon exhibit P. 27 that even the balance of Rs. 295/14/in exhibit P. 23 shown as the excess amount spent by Thevaram Estate was paid off by the Mannarcottai zamindar to the Thevaram Zamindar.\nExhibit P. 27 is an entry dated September 30, 1885 in the account book of Thevaram Zamindar.\nIt show that the Maha raja meaning Thevaram Zamindar gave to Thevaram office Rs. 290.\nIt does not establish the respondent 's version.\nThe only merit of the contention is that the two figures approximate each other.\nIf that figure represents the amount paid by Mannarcottai Zamindar to Thevaram in full discharge of the amount due from the former to the latter, the entry would have run to the effect that the balance of the amount due from Mannarcottai under Ex.p.23 was paid and it would have been credited in Mannarcottai 278 account.\nIt may have been that the sum of Rs. 290/was the balance out of the amount that Thevaram Zamindar took with him when he went to Mannarcottai for meeting his expenditure.\nThe other accounts P. 25 and P. 26 filed in the case are neither full nor clear and no definite conclusion could be arrived at on the basis of the said account.\nWe therefore hold on the evidence and probabilities that Thevaram Zamindar had spent large amounts in connection with the marriage and Mannarcottai zamindar spent only about Rs. 300/ in connection with the said marriage.\nSuch a finding does not bring the marriage within the definition of Asura marriage as explained by us.\nearlier.\nThe expenditure incurred by the bridgegroom 's party was not and could not have been the consideration for the Thevaram Zamindar giving his daughter in marriage.\nIt is contended that the High Court found that there was no 'Kanyadhan ' at the time of the Bangaru Ammal 's marriage and as 'Kanyadhan ' was necessary ingredient of Brahmu marriage, Bangaru Ammal could not have been married in that form.\nThe High Court relying upon the evidence of Veluchami Naicker who is stated to be the Guru of the caste held that 'Kanyadhan ' had not been observed in Bangaru Ammal 's marriage.\nThe learned counsel for the appellant contests the correctness of the finding and he relies upon some invitations in support of his contention that 'Kanyadhan ' was observed in Bangaru Ammal 's marriage but the documents are not clear on the, point.\nThe Guru only narrates some of the ceremonies held in marriages in the community but he does not expressly state that the ceremony of 'Kanyadhan ' was not observed at Bangaru Ammal 's marriage.\nIn this state of evidence the presumption in.\nHindu Law that the marriage was performed in Brahmu form must be invoked.\nAs we have pointed out under the Hindu Law whether a marriage was in Brahmu form or Asura form the Court will presume 279 even where the parties are Shudras that it was in the Brahmu form.\nFurther where it is proved that the marriage was performed in fact the Court will also presume that the necessary ceremonies have been performed.\nSee 'Mauji Lal vs Chandrabati Kumari '(1).\nThis presumption has not been rebutted in this case.\nThat apart the argument of the learned counsel for the respondents mixes up an essential ingredient of the Brahmu marriage, namely the gift of the girl to the bridegroom with a particular form of ritual adopted for making such a gift.\nIn both forms of marriages a girl is given by father or in his absence by any other person entitled to give away the girl to the bridegroom.\nIn the case of Brahmu marriage it takes the form of a gift while in the case of Asura marriage as price is paid by the bridegroom, ,it takes the form of a sale.\nAs we have held that in Bangaru Ammal 's marriage no consideration passed from the bridegroom to the bride 's father, the father must be held to have made a gift of the girl to the bridegroom.\nTo put in other words there was 'Kanyadhan ' in Bangaru Ammal 's marriage.\nWe therefore reject this contention.\nLastly reliance is placed on the conduct of the appellant in not questioning the correctness of the finding given by the learned Subordinate judge in his application for delivery that the marriage was in Asura form.\nThe learned counsel for the appellant sought to explain his conduct but in our opinion nothing turns upon it.\nIf the marriage was not in Asura form as we held it was not, the conduct of the appellant could not possibly make it an Asura marriage.\nIn this view it is not necessary to give

    "summary": "The main question involved in both the appeals was whether the marriage of Bangaru Ammal was in Asura form or in Brahma form.\nThe contention of the appellant was that it was not in Asura form.\nExcept a bare allegation in the plaint that the said marriage was held in Asura form, the plaintiffs did not give any particulars or set up any custom in the community to which the parties to the marriage belonged.\nThey had given evidence that 'a sum of Rs. 1000 was paid as 'Parisam ' to the father of bride but that evidence had been rejected by both the courts.\nRespondents pointed out to the giving of Kambu by bridegroom 's party to the bride 's party at the time of betrothal and expenditure of Rs. 300/ by bridegroom 's party in connection with the marriage of Bangaru Ammal and maintained that it was Asura marriage.\nHeld, that the marriage of Bangaru Ammal was not in Asura form but in Brahma form.\nThere was nothing to show that there was a practice in the family to give Kambu as 'Parisam for the bride or Kambu was paid as 'parisam ' at the time of the betrothal ceremony in connection with the marriage of Bangaru Ammal.\nThe father of the bride had spent large amounts and the bridegroom 's party had spent only about Rs. 300/ in connection with the said marriage.\nThe expenditure incurred by the bridegroom 's party was not and could not have been the consideration for the father giving his daughter in marriage.\nThere is a presumption in Hindu Law that every Hindu marriage is in Brahma form and that pre sumption has not been rebutted in this case.\nThe court was entitled to presume that the necessary ceremony of Kanyadan must have been performed.\nAs no consideration passed from the bridegroom to the father of the bride, the father must be held to have made a gift of the girl to the bridegroom.\n245 The essence of the Asura marriage is the sale of a bride for a price and it is one of the unapproved forms of marriage prohibited by Manu for all the four castes of Hindu society.\nThe vice of the said marriage lies in the receipt of the price by the bride 's father or other persons entitled to give away the bride as a consideration for the bride.\nIf the amount paid or the ornament given is not the consideration for taking the bride but only given to the bride or even to the bride 's father out of affection or in token of respect to them or to comply with a traditional or ritualistic form, such payment does not make the marriage an Asura marriage.\nThere is also nothing in the texts to indicate that the bearing of the expenditure wholly or in part by the bridegroom or his parents is a condition or a criterion of such a marriage, for in such a case the bride 's father or others entitled to give her in marriage do not take any consideration for the marriage, or in any way benefit thereunder.\nThe fact that the bridgeroom 's party bears the expenditure may be due to varied circumstances.\nPrestige, vanity, social custom, the poverty or the disinclination of the bride 's father or some of them may be the reasons for the incurring of expenditure by bridegroom 's father on the marriage but the money so spent is not the price or consideration for the bride.\nEven in a case where the bride 's father, though rich, is disinclined to spend a large amount on the marriage functions and allows the bridegroom to incur the whole or part of it, it cannot be said that he has received any consideration or price for the bride.\nThough in such a case if the bridegroom 's father had not incurred the said expenditure in whole or in part, the bride 's father might have to spend some money on that account, such an indirect result could not be described as price or consideration for giving the bride.\nAsura marriage is a marriage where the bride 's father or any other person entitled to give away the bride takes Sulka or price for giving the bride in marriage.\nThe test is two fold.\nThere shall not only be a benefit to the father, but that benefit shall form a consideration for the sale of the bride.\nWhen this element of consideration is absent, such a marriage cannot be described as Asura marriage.\nJaikisondas Gopaldas vs Harikisandas Hulleshandas Born.\n9, Vijarangam vs Lakshman, (1871) 8 Born.\nH.

No. 132 of 1960).\nNovember 19.\nThe judgment of the court was delivered by SUBBA RAO, J.\nThese appeals filed by a certificate issued by the High Court of judicature at Madras raise a question of Hindu Law pertaining to marriage in 'Asura form '.\nThe material facts may be briefly stated : To appreciate the, facts and the contentions of the parties the 247 following genealogy may be usefully extracted Muthusami Naicker | | | Senior wife Junior wife | | Konda Bommu Naicker Kamayasami Naicker (died 23.10.1873) (died 31.\n7. 1901) | | | | Kandaswami Naicker Ponnuthayee Naicker (died 31.\n7. 1881) (died 13.3 1938) | Banmuga Valla | Konda Bommu Naicker | (died 21.1 1901) | | | | | | | Dorairaja Muthusami Kama Parama | alias (2nd Plff) yasami sivam Married | Thanipuli (3rd Plff)(4th Plff) Errammal | chami (died 2.2.1933) | (1st Plff) | | Bangru Ammual | (died 14.12.1930) | | | married also 8 other wise of whom the last to die were: (a) Meenakshi Ammual (died 5.6. 1938) (b) Krishna Ammual (died 10.11.1938) (c) Vellayammal alias Chinathayammal (died 2.5.\n1940).\n248 Thevaram is an ancient impartible zamindari in Madurai District.\nShanumugavalla Konda Bommu Naicker was zamindar from 23.8.1876 to 20.1.1901.\nOn his death on January 21, 1901 Bangaru Ammal, his daughter, got his entire estate under the will executed by him.\nTo discharge the debts incurred by her father Bangaru Ammal executed on March 13, 1913 a mortgage of her properties for a sum of Rs. 2,15,000/ in favour of one Chidambram Chettiar.\nOn his death his son Veerappa Chettiar filed on April 16, of 1925 against Bangaru Ammal in the Subordinate judge 's Court, Dindigul for the recovery of a sum of Rs. 5,49,6338 7 being the balance of the amount due under the said mortgage.\nThe suit was compromised and on July 28, 1928, a compromise decree was passed therein.\nUnder the compromise decree the mortgaged properties were divided into three Schedules A, B & C and it was provided that if a sum of Rs. 3,75,000/ was paid by July 31, 1931, the mortgage must be deemed to have been fully discharged but in default the properties in Schedule A of the decree were to become the absolute properties of the plaintiff.\nB Schedule properties i.e., some of the pannai lands and the C Schedule properties, i.e., those already alienated by Bangaru Ammal were released from the mortgage.\nOne K. V. Ramasami Iyer, the Manager of the estate was appointed Receiver of the A Schedule properties and he was directed to deposit the surplus income into court towards the payment of the amount due under the compromise decree.\nBefore the expiry of the period prescribed under the said decree Bangaru Ammal died on December 14, 1930, and her mother Errammal claiming to be her heir on the ground that Bangaru Ammal 's marriage was held in 'Asura form ' filed I.A. No. 190 of 1931 in the court of the Subordinate judge, Dindigul, for directing the Receiver to hand over the estate to her.\nVeerappa Chettiar in his turn filed I.A.No.170 of 1932 for 249 directing the Receiver to deliver possession of A Schedule properties on the ground that the term prescribed under the compromise decree had expired and the balance of the amount due under the decree was not paid to him.\nIn the petition filed by Errammal she raised the question of the validity and the binding nature of the compromise decree on her.\nAfter elaborate inquiry on February 1, 1933, the learned Subordinate judge, though he held that the marriage of Bangaru Ammal was in 'Asura form ', dismissed her petition for the reason that the mortgage was valid and binding on her and allowed the petition filed by Veerappa Chettiar directing the delivery of the possession of A Schedule properties to him.\nOn February 2, 1933, Veerappa Chettiar had taken delivery of A Schedule properties and on July 19, 1933 he was registered as proprietor of Thevaram estate by the Collector of Madura.\nOn February 2, 1933, Errammal died executing a will dated January 30, 1933, in favour of her nephew Thangachami Naicker.\nIt may also be mentioned that three of the co widows of Shanmugavalla survived Errammal.\nThey died one after another and the last of them Vellayammal passed away on May 2, 1940.\nThangachami Naicker along with one of the widows filed appeals to the High Court against the said judgments but those appeals were dismissed by the High Court on the ground that they were not maintainable.\nAs Thangachami Naicker interfered with the right of Veerappa Chettiar with regard to certain tanks and water courses in Zamindari he filed 0.\nsection 2 of 1934 in the Subordinate judge 's court of Dindigul against Thanchami Naicker and obtained a decree declaring his right to the said tanks.\nThe appeal filed by Thanchami Naicker against that decree was also dismissed with costs on April 10, 1940.\nIn execu tion of the decree for costs Veerappa Chettiar got the property alleged to be in possession of Thanchami 250 Naicker attached.\nOne section Michael (son of Thanchami Naicker) objected to the attachment of the said property on the basis of a sale in his favour by the alleged reversioners to the estate of Bangaru Ammal.\nThat petition was dismissed on August 23, 1944.\nThe said claimant section Michael filed 0.\nsection No. 52 of 1944 in the court of the Subordinate judge, Dindigul for setting aside the said claim order.\nTo that suit Veerappa Chettiar and Thangachami Naicker were made party defendants.\nOn January 31, 1945 the alleged reversioners to the estate of Bangaru Ammal filed 0.\nsection 14 of 1,945 in the Court of the Subordinate judge, Dindigul against Veerappa Chettiar, his younger brother and defendants 3 & 9 who were alleged to be the tenants in possession of some of the items of the plaint Schedule properties.\nThe plaintiffs in that suit are the grandsons of one Kandaswamy Naicker shown in the genealogy a paternal uncle of Shanmugavalla Konda Bommu Naicker.\nThey claimed that they are the reversioners to the estate of Bangaru Ammal on the ground that Bangaru Ammal was married in 'Asura form '.\nIt is alleged in the plaint that succession opened in their favour when Vellayammal died on May 2, 1940 and that the compromise decree passed against Bangaru Ammal was not binding on them and that in any view the property set out in Schedule C and C 1 attached to the plaint did not pass to Veerappa Chettiar under the said decree.\nThe contesting defendants in both the suits pleaded that the marriage of Bangaru Ammal was not in 'Asura form ', and therefore the plaintiffs in 0.\nsection 52 of 1944 were not the reversioners to the estate of Bangaru Ammal, that the compromise decree was binding on the estate and that C and C 1 Schedule properties also passed to the decree holder thereunder and that in any view the suit was barred by time.\n251 It is seen from the foregoing narration of facts that the same questions of fact and law arise in both the suits for the title of the plaintiffs in 0.\nsection No. 52 of 1944 was derived under a sale deed from the plaintiffs ' in 0.\nsection No. 14 of 1945.\nTherefore the plaintiffs ' claim in the former suit will stand or fall on the plaintiffs ' title in the latter suit.\nFor that reason both the suits were heard together by the Subordinate judge and appeals arising from his common judgment by the High Court.\nThe learned Subordinate judge held on the evidence that the marriage of Bangaru Ammal with the Mannarkottai zamindar was in Asura form as Mannarkottai zamindar had spent Rs. 300/ to Rs. 575 for Bangaru Ammal 's marriage and that circumstance was in view of certain decisions of the High Court would make it an Asura marriage.\nHe further held that the aforesaid compromise decree was binding on the plaintiffs.\nAs regards C and C. 1 Schedule properties lie held that they had passed to Veerappa Chettiar under the compromise decree as part of the Thevaram Zamindari and that the plaintiffs were not in possession within 12 years of the suit in regard to item 70 of the C Schedule.\nOn those findings he dismissed O.S. No. 14 of 1945 with costs.\nIn O.S. 52 of 1944 he held that the plaintiff therein acquired a valid title as he purchased the land in dispute therein from the plaintiffs in the other suit who are the reversioners to the estate of Bangaru Ammal and that the decree in execution of which the said property was attached was not binding on the estate of said Bangaru Ammal.\nIn that view he decreed the said suit.\nAs against the decree passed in O.S. 52 of 1944, Veerappa Chettiar filed an appeal in the High Court of Madras being A.S. No. 816 of 1947.\nAs against decree in O.S. 14 of 1945 dismissing the 252 plaintiffs ' suit they filed an appeal to the High Court being A.S. 83 of 1948.\nVeerappa Chettiar filed cross objections therein.\nBoth the appeals were heard together by the High Court.\nThe High Court held that in Bangaru Ammal 's marriage the practice of giving Kambu or flour or what is called the taking of Mappetti (millet flour box) before the betrothal was followed and that the marriage expenses were entirely borne by the Mannarcottai Zamindar presumably in pursuance of the practice existing in the community or in pursuance of an arrangement between the parties and therefore the marriage was Asura.\nThe High Court further held that under the compromise decree only Melwaram right in C and C. 1 Schedule properties passed to Veerappa Chettiar but as there was no clear evidence as to who was in actual possession of the said lands and as the persons in actual occupation of the land were not impleaded in the suit, it was necessary in the interest of the parties to reserve the right of the plaintiffs to recover possession of C and C. I Schedule lands in an appropriate proceedings instituted for the purpose.\nIn regard to item No. 70 of C. Schedule land the High Court agreed with the finding of the Subordinate judge.\nThe High Court also negatived the plea of limitation, with the result A.S. No. 816 of 1947 was dismissed with costs and A.S. No. 83 of 1948 subject to the said modification was dismissed with costs.\nHence the appeals.\nBoth the appeals were heard together as they raised common points.\nThe arguments of Mr. A.V. Viswanatha Sastri, the counsel for the appellant, may be summarised thus : The marriage of Bangaru Ammal with a Mannarcottai Zamindar was not held in Asura form and therefore the plaintiffs in O.S. 52 of 1944 being her father 's uncle 's grand children were not reversioners to her estate.\nAccording to Hindu Dharamshastras the main distinction between Brahma, and Asura form of marriages is that while in the 253 former there is a gift of the bride, in the latter there is a sale of the bride.\nExcept a bare allegation in the plaints that the said marriage was held in Asura form the plaintiffs did not give any particulars or set tip any custom in the community to which the parties to the marriage belonged.\nThey have adduced evidence to the effect that a sum of Rs. 1,000/ was paid as parisam by the Mannarcottai Zamindar to the bride 's father for taking the bride but both the courts having rightly held that the said payment was not established by the evidence erred in making out a case of a different consideration for the marriage.\nThe first court held wrongly that the fact that Mannarcottai Zamindar spent Rs. 300/ to Rs. 575/for the marriage expenses would make it an asura marriage while the High Court went further and erroneously held that there was a general custom in the community to pay the bride 's price by way of giving Kambu grain and Kambu flour at the time of the settlement of marriage and that for the bridegroom 's party to bear the expenditure for celebrating the marriage and that in the case of Bangaru Ammal 's marriage the said Kambu was given and that the expenditure for the marriage was incurred by the Mannarcottai Zamindar presumably in pursuance of the practice existing in the community or in pursuance of an arrangement between the parties.\nApart from the fact that no such custom was pleaded, there was no evidence to sustain the said custom.\nThat apart the mere giving of Kambu as a ceremonial relic of the past or the bearing of the expenditure on the marriage wholly or partly by the bridegroom 's party could not be a bride 's price as contemplated by the Sastras, for the bride 's father in those events could not be said to have received any price for the bride.\nIn short the learned counsel attacks both the legal and the factual findings arrived at by the High Court.\nThe gist of the learned counsel for the Mr. Bheemasankaran 's contention may 254 be briefly stated thus: According to Dharam Shastras there were eight forms of marriage in Hindu Law, four approved and four unapproved.\nBut as centuries rolled by most of them became obsolete and at present there are only two forms of marriage, Brahmu and Asura.\nWhatever may have been their comparative merits in the bygone days, they have now come to be recognized as two valid 1, forms of marriage that can be followed without any sense of inferiority by all the castes.\nThough in remote antiquity the Asura form of marriage night have involved a real sale transaction, at present it would be enough to constitute such a marriage if a ritual form was observed indicating the consciousness of the community or the parties contracting the marriage that it was an Asura marriage.\nThis consciousness may be indicated by the ceremonial giving of Kambu at the time of betrothal or by the bridegroom 's party meeting the expenses wholly or substantially of the marriage.\nThai apart in the present case there is clear evidence that the practice in the community to which Bangaru Ammal and her husband belonged that Kambu is given by the bridegroom 's party to the bride 's party at the time of betrothal and the bridegroom 's party bears the expenditure of the marriage which clearly indicate that the bride 's father or in his absence by the bride 's relatives entitled to give her away in marriage get a clear benefit for giving the bride, and further there is evidence that the said practice was followed in the case of Bangaru Ammal 's marriage.\nWhat is more to constitute a Brahmu marriage there should be a 'Kanyadhan ' but in this case it has been found that there was no 'Kanyadhan ' and therefore if the marriage of Bangaru Ammal could not have been in 'Brahma form ' it could have been only in the alternative form, namely Asura form.\nBefore we advert to the arguments advanced we would like to make some general observations.\n255 We are not concerned here with the relatives importance of the said two forms of marriages at the present day but only with the conditions laid down by Shastras for the said two forms of marriage and with a question as to which form was adopted in Bangaru Ammal 's marriage.\nNor are we concerned with a question whether the institution of marriage in Brahmu form is now maintained in its original purity.\nWe are also in these appeals not concerned with any customary form of marriage but only with a marriage sanctioned by Hindu Law, for no custom was pleaded in derogation of Hindu Law.\nBut there may be a custom in a community not in derogation of the Hindu Law but in regard to the manner of complying with a condition laid down by Hindu Law.\nthat is to say if the criterion for an Asura marriage was that there should be a sale of the bride, there may be a custom in a community in regard to the manner of paying the consideration ' for the sale.\nIt may be mentioned that in this case the learned counsel for the respondents does not rely upon any custom even in the later sense but only on the practice obtaining in the community in support of the evidence that the said practice was followed in Bangaru Ammal 's marriage.\nThe main question therefore is what are the ingredients of an Asura form of marriage.\nAs the Manu Samhita has always been treated by sages and commentators from the earliest time as being of a paramount authority, let us look to it for guidance.\nThe following verses from Manu Samhita as translated by Manmatha Nath Dutt Shastri read as follows: CHAPTER III, Verse 21: They (different types of marriages) are known as the Brahma, Daiva A 'raha, Prajapatya, A 'sura, Gandharva, Rakshasa and Paisacha, which forms the eighth.\n256 Verse 24: The four forms of marriage the seers have ordained as proper for Brahmanas : only the Rakshasa form as proper for Kshatriyas, and the A 'sura form as proper for Vais 'yas and S 'udras.\nVerse 25: Thus out of these five forms of marriage, three are lawful, and two are sinful (unlawful).\nLet a man never marry a wife either in the Pisacha or in the A 'sura form since these two forms are prohibited.\nVerse 27: The form (of marriage) in which well attired bride, decorated with ornaments, is given in marriage to an erudite, good charactered bridegroom especially invited by the bride 's father himself to receive her, is called Brahma.\nVerse 31: The form, in which the bridegroom, on paying money to her father and to herself, out of the promptings, of his own desire, receives the bride in marriage, is called A 'sura.\nVerse 51 : An erudite father of a girl shall not take anything by way of Sulka from her bridegroom.\nBy taking a dowry out of greed, he becomes the seller of his off spring.\nVerse 53: Even the acceptance of abovine pair (by the father of the bride from the bridegroom) is designated as a dowry by certain authorities, (the acceptance of) 257 a dowry be it costly, or be it of insignificant value, constitutes the sale of the girl.\nVerse 54 : A marriage in which the bride 's relations do accept the dowry (voluntarily presented by the bridegroom 's father, etc.) is no sale (of the bride), since such a present is but an adoration of the bride done out of love or affection.\nVerse 98 (of Chapter IX) Even a S 'udra must not take any price it.\nduty or pecuniary consideration) for the hands of his daughter when giving her away in marriage.\nSuch acceptance of money constitutes a sale of the girl in disguise.\nThe gist of the verses is that before Manu Smriti came into existence the A 'sura form was considered to be proper for Vaishs and Sudras but it was prohibited for the Brahmins and Kashatriyas.\nBut Manu was emphatic that the said form of marriage was sinful for all castes including the Shudras.\nThere is no ambiguity in the verses in regard to the general prohibition to all castes ' for Verse No. 98 emphasizes that even a S 'udra must not take any price for the hand of his daughter when giving away in marriage.\nThe next question is what is the criterion of an A 'sura marriage according to Manu.\nA contrast between the terminology in the definition of Brahma marriage and that of A 'sura marriage brings out clearly his intention.\nThe following words stand out in the definitions.\nThey are 'dana ' (giving) 'Kanyapradanam ' (the taking of the bride), \"Dravina ' (wealth), 'dattava ' (after having given), 'Saktitah ' (as much as he can), 'Svacchandya ' (as according to his will).\nThe word 'Apradana ' is used in the 258 definition of A 'sura marriage in contradistinction to the word 'dana ' in Brahmu form of marriage, while a, in the Brahmu form of marriage the father makes a gift of the bride, in the A 'sura form the bridegroom takes the bride otherwise than by a gift.\nIn the former the father gives the bride decorated with ornaments, while in the latter the bridegroom takes the bride after giving wealth to the father of the bride and the bride.\nWhile in the former the father voluntarily gives the bride in the latter the bridegroom out of his own will pays as much money as he can to the father and takes his bride.\nThe words Saktitah ' and 'Svacchandya ' imply that the payment is made because the bridegroom can and the girl is taken because he wills that is to say a bridegroom who seeks the hand of a bride takes her as he can afford to buy her from her father.\nThe transaction is equated to that of a sale, for all the ingredients of sale were present.\nIf there is any ambiguity that is dispelled by Verse 51 and Verse 54.\nIn Verse 51 Manu makes it clear that by taking a dowry out of greed the father becomes the seller of his off spring. 'Sulka ' means the taking of a gratuity or price.\nThe expression 'dravina ' in Verse 31 is clarified by the use of the word 'Sulka ' in Verse 51.\nWhat is prohibited is Sulka or the price for the bride.\nVerse 54 brings out the distinction between 'Sulka ' or 'dravina ' paid by the bridegroom as a price for the bride and the dowry given for the bride as a present out of love or affection or in adoration of the bride.\nVerse 98 further empbasizes that what Manu prohibits is the sale of a bride for price.\nA 'sura marriage, according to Manu, is a transaction of sale in which the girl is sold for a price.\nPractically the same meaning though expressed in different phraseology is given by other Hindu Law givers.\nThe following translations given by Max Muller in the \"Sacred Books of the East ', of 259 the various sages may now be extracted Baudhayana text 1, II, 20 (7) '(If the bridegroom receives a maiden) after gladdening (the parents) by money (that is) the rite of the Asuras (asura). ' Verse 2 : 'Now they quote also (the following verses) It is declared that a female who has been purchased for money is not a wife.\nShe cannot (assist) as sacrifices offered to the Gods or the manes.\nKasyapa has stated that she is a slave. ' Baudhayana Prasad Adhyaya 11, Kandika 21 Verse 3 : 'Those wicked men who, seduced by agreed, give away a daughter for a fee, who (thus) fall (after death) into a dreadful place of punishment and destroy their family down to the seventh (generation).\nMoreover they will repeatedly die and be born again.\nAll (this) is declared (to happen), if a fee (is taken ).\n, Vasishtha Chapter I Verse 35. 'If, after making a bargain (with the father, a suitor) marries (a damsel) purchased for money, that (is called) the Manusha rite. ' Narada Chapter XII Ver8e 42.\nWhen a price is (asked for the bride by the father and) taken (by him), it is the form termed Asura. 'Gautama, 'Chapter IV Verse 11.\nThe form of marriage in which a bride is purchased for money, is called the A 'suram. ' 260 Vishnu Chapter XXIV Verse 24.\nIf the damsel is sold (to the bridegroom), it is called an Asura marriage. 'Yagngavalkya ' : 'The asura by largely giving of money ; the Gandharva by mutual consent; the Rakshasa by forcible taking by waging war and Paisacha by deceiving the girl ' Translation of Srisachandra Vidyaamava : 1918 Edition page 126 : In the Mitakshara the said text is commented upon thus : .lm15 \" The Asura marriage is that in which money is largely given (to the father and others in exchange for the girl).\n'Apastamba ':\"If the suitor pays money (for his bride) and marries her (afterwards) that (marriage is called) the Asura rite. ' 'Kautilya ': Arthasastra: Sulkadanat Asura ' the word used is \"Sulka\" Medhatithi, in his commentary on Verse 54 of Manu Samhita points out that the receipt of money or money 's worth for the benefit of the girl (Kanyarthe) does not amount to her sale, and is desirable as it tends to enhance her self esteem and also raises her in the estimation of others, and concludes with the observation that receipt of a dowry for the girl (kanyartham danagrahanam) is prescribed by thus stating the good arising from it (arthavadena) : Vide at 772.\nApte 's Dictionary : page 239 : Col. III.\nAsura is explained thus : 'One of the eight forms of marriage in which the bridegroom purchase ; the bride from her father or other paternal kinsmen ' Manu 331 and Yagnayavalkya 1.61 are cited 261 The said sages and commentators accepted the view expressed by Manu and in effect described A 'sura marriage as the transaction where a bridegroom purchases a girl for a price paid to the father of the girl or to kinsmen who are en titled to give her in marriage.\nThe distinction between the bride 's price and the presents to the bride is also recognized.\nThe learned judges of the High Court relying upon the text of Apasthamba observed that 'the payment to the bride 's father is for the purpose of complying with Dharma and not as a consideration for an commercial transaction.\nThe interpretation may explain away on Dharmic principles the sordid nature of the transaction, but does not detract from its essential incidents.\nWe, therefore, hold that A 'sura marriage is nothing more than a transaction of marriage whereunder a bridegroom takes a bride for the price paid by him to the bride 's father or others entitled to give her and therefore in substance it is a sale of the bride.\nIt is said that the incurring of the expenditure of the marriage by the bridegroom is also a consideration for giving the bride.\nIn this context reliance is placed on the Law and Custom of Hindu Castes by Arthur Steel.\nThis book was written in 1868.\nThe author appears to have collected the laws and customs obtaining in the Presidency of Bombay, and had compiled them for the purpose of convenience of reference.\nAt page 24 the author says: 'There are eight kinds of marriages recognized in the Sastras : 1, Brahm, where the charges are incurred solely by the girl 's father; x x x x x 5, Usoor, where she is taken in exchange for wealth, and married; this species is peculiar in the Wys and Soodra castes, B.S.(Mit), See Munoo, 3.20,34.\nIt is considered as Uscorwiwuha, and stree soolk, and the money, if unpaid, is an unlawful debt, B 2, 199.\nThe definition of Asura by the author does not carry the matter further, for it is consistent with that 262 given in the Hindu law Texts but what is relied upon is his definition of Brahmu marriage as one where charges are incurred solely by the girl 's father.\nFrom the said definition a converse proposition is sought to be drawn viz : that marriage would be Asura marriage if the charges were incurred mainly by the bridegroom 's father.\nFirstly the definition of Brahmu marriage by the learned Author does not conform with the definition of the said marriage by the lawgivers.\nSecondly it does not follow from the passage that if the bridegroom 's father incurs the expenditure the marriage is an Asura marriage.\nIf that be so, the author would have stated in his definition of Asura marriage that such incurring of the expenditure would make a marriage an Asura marriage.\nThis valuable compilation of the laws and customs of the day does not throw any light on the question now raised before us.\nLet us now see whether there is any merit in the contention that the concept of sale for a price has by progress of time lost its content and that at the present time a mere form of sale irrespective of a real benefit to the bride 's father would meet the requirements of an Asura , marriage.\nNo text or commentary taking that view has been cited to us.\nIndeed the case law on the subject does not countenance any such subsequent development.\nThe earliest decision on the subject cited to us is that ofthe Divisional Bench of the Bombay High Court \"Jaikisondas Gopaldas vs Harkisondas Hulleshandas '.Green j, defines the Asura marriage at page 13 'The essential characteristic of the Asura form ofmarriage appears to be the giving of money or presents by the bridegroom or his family to the father or parental kinsmen of the bride,, or, in tact, a sale of the girl by her father or other relation having the disposal of her in marriage in (1) Bom.\n9. 263 consideration of money or money 's worth paid to them by the intended husband or his family.

C. Reports 244.\n(2) (3) Bom.\n264 money consideration for it, the substance of the transaction makes it, according to Hindu Law, not a gift but a sale of the girl.\nThe money received is what is called bride price; and that is the essential element of the Asura form.\nThe fact that the rites prescribed for the Brahmu form are gone through cannot take it out of that category, if there was pecuniary benefit to the giver of the girl.\nThe Hindu law givers one and all condemn such benefit and the Shastras, regarding it as an ineradicable sin, prescribe no penance for the sale of a bride.\n\" The learned judge also accepted the presumption that every marriage under the Hindu Law is according to the Brahma form but it can be rebutted by evidence.\nIn 'section Authikesavulu Chetty vs section Ramanujan Chetty ' (1) at the betrothal ceremony a married woman of the caste to which the parties belonged proceeded from the bridegroom 's house to the house of the bride carrying certain presents consisting of cocoanuts, betel and nut, garlands, black beads, saffron red powder, etc.\nin a tray.\nThere was also a pagoda and a fanam in it.\nThere was also an arrangement at that time that the bridegroom 's father had to pay certain amount to the bride and the bride 's father had also to give some jewels to the bridegroom.\nIt was contended that the marriage was an Asura marriage.\nThe learned judges said that the distinctive mark of the Asura marriage was the payment of money for the bride, and that the payment of a pagoda and 2 1/2 annas could not have been intended to be the consideration for the bride where the bride 's father spent thousands of rupees himself and gave presents of considerable value to the bride and the bridegroom.\nThis decision, therefore, emphasises that mere payment of small amounts as a compliment to one of the parents cannot be treated as a consideration for the sale of the bride.\nIt also lays down that all the circumstances of the case will have to be looked into to ascertain whether any amount was paid as price for the bride.\n(1) Mad.\n265 A Divisional Bench of the Madras High Court in 'Gabrielnathaswmi vs Valliammai Ammal ' (1) negatived the contention that the mere fact that a bride 's parents received what is known as 'parisam ' it would lead to the conclusion that the marriage of the girl took place in Asura form and not in Brahma form.\nThe learned judges observed: \"It may be that parisum is a relic of what in old days was regarded as the price for the bride.\nx x x x The real test is whether in the community or among the parties the payment of 'parisam ' was tacitly understood as being substantially a payment for taking the girl in marriage.\nThat will depend generally upon the evidence in the case.\n\" They also reaffirmed the presumption under Hindu Law in; the following words : 'Ordinarily the presumption is that whatever may be the caste to which the parties belong, a marriage should be regarded as being in the Brahma form unless it can be shown that it was in the Asura form '.\nThis decision deals with 'parisam ' with which we are also concerned in these appeals.\nThis is an authority for the proposition that the use of the word 'parisam ' is not decisive of the question that it is a bride 's price, but that it must be established in each case whether the payment small or large, in cash or kind, is made as a bride 's price i. c. as consideration for the bride.\nIn \"Ratnathanni vs Somasundara Mudaliar\" (2) a sum of Rs. 200/ was paid to the bride 's mother for the expenses of the marriage as a term of the contract of the marriage.\nOn that finding Ramesam. ' J. concluded that the payment was made for the benefit of the bride 's mother as in the absence of the payment, she would have had to find the amount in some other way, by borrowing or pledging her jewels or other properties and therefore the marriage was in Asura form.\nThe learned judge relied upon Steel 's observation that the parents should incur the expenditure of the marriage in the Brahma form and presumably (1) A.I.R. 1920 Mad. 884.\n(2) 266 drew a contrary inference that if the bridegroom 's party met the expenditure it would be an Asura marriage.\nThe learned judge also relied upon that decision in 'Muthu Aiyar vs Chidambara Aiyar '(1).\nSpencer, J. in a separate judgement agreed with him.\nAs we have pointed out we do not see any justification in the Hindu Law texts in support of the view that the bearing of the expenditure of the marriage by the bridegroom is a test of an Asura marriage.\nThe fact that the expenditure of the marriage is borne by bridegroom 's party cannot in any sense of the term be a consideration given to the father for taking the bride.\nRamesam J. sitting singly in 'Samu Asari vs Anachi Ammal ' (2) restated his view in a more emphatic form.\nHe observed: 'It seems to me immaterial whether it is the whole of the expenses of the marriage or a substantial portion of it.\nTo the extent the bride 's father gets contribution of that kind from the bridegroom 's father, he benefits by it; though he does not pocket it, but he spends for the marriage. .\nAt the same time the learned judge observed that under certain circumstances payments made to the bride 's parents which are either small or relatively small having regard to the scale in which the expenses of the marriage are incurred do not make a marriage an Asura marriage.\nThis decision therefore makes a distinction between courtesy presents given to the bride 's parents and whole or substantial portion of the expenditure incurred by the bridegroom 's father.\nWhile we agree that courtesy presents to the bride 's parents cannot by themselves conceivably make a marriage an Asura one, we find it difficult to hold that the incurring of expenditure by a bridegroom satisfies the test of consideration for the bride.\nIn 'Kailasanatha Mudaliar vs Parasakthi Vadivanni ', (3) Varadachar J., speaking for the (1) (2) (3) Mad.\n267 Court lays down the test of the Asura marriage in the following manner : \"The distinctive feature of the Asura form of marriage is the giving of money or money 's worth to the bride 's father for his benefit or as consideration for his giving the girl in marriage.\n\" The learned judge distinguishes the case of \"Samu Asari vs Anachi Ammal ' (1) on the ground that there money was held to have been paid for the father 's benefit though utilized by him to meet the expense of the marriage which he must have defrayed out of his own fund and points out also the distinction between payment to the father for his own benefit and payments to the bride received by kinsmen not for their own use.\nIn that case a jewel was presented by the bride 's father and placed on the bride 's neck at the time of the betrothal ceremony as ' parisam ' and the value of the jewel was not even the subject of a bargain but merely left to the pleasure of the bridegroom 's father.\nThe learned judge observed that such a gift could in no sense be called bride 's price.\nIn 'Sivangalingam Pillai vs K. V. Ambalavana Pillai, (2) the bride 's father gave a large amount and also jewels to the bride and plaintiff 's brother in law on behalf of the bridegroom gave the bride 's father a present of Rs. 1,000/ and a cloth worth Rs. 65/ .\nIt was also agreed that all the expenses of the marriage should be borne by the bridegroom.\nIt was contended that the said presents and the incurring of expenditure on the marriage was a consideration for the bride and therefore the marriage was in an Asura form.\nThe Divisional Bench rejected the contention.\nPandrang Row J. observed at page 481: \"It is a well known fact that, whatever the custom is, the bridegroom and his people also spend a considerable sum of money in respect of the marriage whenever they can afford it.\nSuch expenditure obviously does not convert the marriage which is otherwise in the Brahma form into one which is in (1) (2) A.I.R. 1938.\n479. 268 the Asura form.\n\" The learned judge proceeded to state at page 480 thus : \"So far as our Presidency is concerned, all marriages among Hindus are presumed to be in the Brahma form unless it is proved that they were in the Asura form; in other words, it is incumbent on the party who alleges that a particular marriage was in the Asura form to prove that bride price was paid in respect of the marriage by the bridegroom or his people to the bride 's father\" and the present given to the bride 's father the learned judge remarked that this customary present would not necessarily amount to payment of bride 's price.\nAbdur Rahman J., added that 'if a party wishes to assert that the marriage was Asuric in form, he must establish that some price was paid for the bride in pursuance of either of an express or implied contract to the bride 's father or on his account.\n\" This judgment we may say so with respect puts the principle on a correct legal basis and brings out in bold relief the distinction between bird 's price on the one hand and the presents and the expenditure incurred in respect of the marriage by one or the other of the parties on the other hand Patanjali Sastri J., in 'V.S. Velavutha Pandaram vs section Suryamurthi Pillai ' (1) approached the case if we may say so from a correct perspective.\nThere a sum of Rs.500/ was paid by the bridegroom to the bride 's father for the specific purpose of making jewels for the bride in pursuance of a stipulation for such gift as a condition of giving the girl in marriage.\nThe learned, judge held that the said payment was not bride 's price and did not make the marriage an Asura marriage.\nThe learned judge in passing referred to the case of 'Samu Asari vs Anachi Ammal ' (2), and observed as follows : \" 'As the father was benefitted by such contribution in that he was relieved to that extent from defraying such expenses (1) (2) 269 himself, the marriage was one in the Asura form.\nThis view has been criticised in the latest edition of Mayne 's Hindu Law as not really warranted by the Hindu Law texts, and the point may have to be reconsidered when it arises.\n\" Patanjali Sastri, J., again considered this point in Second Appeal No. 2272 of 1945.\nThere on the occasion of the marriage one sovereign was given along with the other presents to the bride 's father as Memmekkanoni.\nThe question was whether the mere adoption of this customary form per se brought the marriage within the category of an Asura or unapproved marriage.\nThe learned judge expressed the view that the payment of memekanom no longer signifies in substance and in truth consideration for the transfer of the girl but has survived as a token ceremonial payment forming part of the marriage ritual.\nThe said judgment was confirmed by a Divisional Bench of the said High Court in 'Vedakummpprath Pillai Muthu appellant vs Kulathinkai Kuppan '.\n(1) Balakrishna Ayyar, J., speaking for the Bench neatly summarised the law on the subject at page 804 thus : \"One essential feature of an Asura marriage, the feature which makes the form objectionable, is that the father of the bride receives a gratuity or fee for giving the girl in marriage.\nOrdinarily, it would be expected of every decent and respectable father when he selects a husband for his daughter to make his selection uninfluenced by any considerations other than the welfare of the girl.\nBut when he receives a payment for his personal benefit, a very objectionable factor would influence his selection and it is clearly this which the ancient lawgivers took objection to and therefore relegated the form to the category we call 'disapproved '.\nWhen the father accepts money and allows his greed or avarice to sway his judgment, he thereby converts what is intended to be a sacrament into a commercial transaction.\n\" With respect we are in full agreement with the observations of the learned judge.\nCommenting upon the (1) 270 argument built upon the payment of one sovereign to the bride 's father the learned judge observed : \"In most, though not necessarily in all cases, the payment has lost all its original significance and survives only as a ritualistic form '; it has become a ceremonial symbol devoid of any content or meaning or purpose.\nx x x x Now when a father gives such a large amount as stridhanam and receives one sovereign in compliance with traditional form it would be very wrong to say that he had been selling or mortgaging the girl and that he received the sovereign from greed or love of gain.\n\" The foregoing discussion leads to the following results .\nUnder Hindu Law marriage is a sacrament and it is the religious duty of the father to give his daughter in marriage to a suitable person but if he receives a payment in cash or in kind as a consideration for giving his daughter in marriage he would be converting a sacrament into a commercial transaction.\nBrahma marriage satisfies the said test laid down by Hindu Law.\nBut from Vedic times seven other forms of marriage were recognized based on custom and convenience.\nAsura form is one of the eight forms of marriage.\nThe essence of the said marriage is the sale of a bride for a price and it is one of the unapproved forms of marriage prohibited by Manu for all the four castes of Hindu society.\nThe vice of the said marriage lies in the receipt of the price by the bride 's father or other persons entitled to give away the bride as a consideration for the bride.\nIf the amount paid or the ornaments given is not the consideration for taking the bride but only given to the bride or even to the bride 's father out of affection or in token of respect to them or to comply with a traditional or ritualistic form, such payment does not make the marriage an A 'sura marriage.\nThere is also nothing in the texts to indicate that the bearing 271 of the expenditure wholly or in part by the, bridegroom or his parents is a condition or a criterion of such a marriage, for in such a case the bride 's father or others entitled to give her in marriage do not take any consideration for the marriage, or any way benefit thereunder.\nThe fact that the 'bridegroom 's party bears the expenditure may be due to varied circumstances.\nPrestige, vanity, social custom, the poverty or the disinclination of the bride 's father or some of them may be the reasons for the incurring of expenditure by bridegroom 's father on the marriage but the money so spent is not the price or consideration for the bride.\nEven in a case where the bride 's father though rich is disinclined to spend a large amount on the marriage functions and allows the bridegroom to incur the whole or part of it, it cannot be said that he has received any consideration or price for the bride.\nThough in such a case if the bridegroom 's father had not incurred the said expenditure in whole or in part, the bride 's father might have to spend some money, on that account such as indirect result could not be described as price or consideration for giving the bride.\nShortly stated Asura marriage is a marriage where the bride 's father or any other person entitled to give away the bride takes Sulka or price for giving the bride in marriage.\nThe test is two fold: There shall not only be a benefit to the father, but that benefit shall form a consideration for the sale of the bride.\nWhen this element of consideration is absent, such a marriage cannot be described as Asura marriage.\nAs the Asura marriage does not comply with the strict standards of Hindu Law it is not only termed as an unapproved marriage, but it has been consistently held that whenever a question arises whether a marriage is a Brahmu or Asura, the presumption is that the marriage is in Brahma form and the burden is upon the person who asserts the con trary to prove that the marriage was either an Asura or any other form.\n272 With this background let us look at the facts of the case.\nThough in both the plaints it is stated that Bangaru Ammal had been married in Asura form, no particulars are given but in the evidence the plaintiff 's witnesses in one voice depose that the custom in the Rakambala caste to which Bangaru Ammal and her husband belonged, is to give money in the shape of 'parisam ' to the bride 's father at the time of the betrothal.\nThe witnesses who depose to Bangaru Ammal 's marrage say that at the time of her betrothal a sum of 1,000/ was paid as ' parisam '.\nBoth the Courts did not accept this evidence and they held that it had not been established that a sum of Rs. 1,000/ was paid as 'parisam ' at the time of the betrothal of Bangaru Ammal.\nThis finding is not attacked before us.\nIt is argued that the evidence discloses that there is a practice in the said caste to give Kambu as IT parisam ' to the bride 's father as a bride 's price and the said practice supports the evidence that in the case of the marriage of Bangaru Ammal also such a 'parisam ' was paid as consideration for the marriage.\nOn the question of the said alleged practice the evidence does not support it.\nP. W. I to P. W. 10 depose.\nthat \"parisam ' is paid in cash for marriages in their community varying from Rs. 150/ to Rs. 1,000/ .\nThis evidence has been rightly ' disbelieved by both the courts.\nThe evidence does not bear out the case of giving of 'parisam ' in Kambu.\nSome of the witnesses also depose to the payment of Rs. 1000/ as 'parisam ' at Bangaru Ammal 's marriage but that was not accepted by the courts.\nThe evidence destroys the case that 'parisam ' was paid at her marriage in Kambu.\nNo witness examined in the two cases says that Kambu is paid at the marriages of the members of the community or was paid at the time of Bangaru Ammal 's marriage as a consideration for the marriage but it is said that the witnesses who had been 273 examined in the earlier suit whose evidence has been marked by consent in the present case deposes to that fact.\nErrammal, the mother of Bangaru Ammal, whose evidence is marked as P. 11 (R) deposes that when Thevaram Zamindar married her the 'parisam ' was only Rs. 1,000/ and that when her daughter was married, the 'parisam ' was also Rs. 1000/ .\nIn cross examination she says that according to the custom of the community, it is the practice to bring a mapelli for the nischithartham (betrothal function) and it is customary also to bring cumbu and flour at the time of the marriage and sprinkle it in the marriage hall.\nThis evidence indicates that the 'parisam ' is only given in cash but Kambu is brought at the time of the marriage and sprinkled in the marriage hall presumably for the purpose of purification.\nThis evidence does not show that Kambu is given as \"parisam ' for taking the bride.\nSermalai Naicker who gave evidence in an earlier suit which is marked as P. 11 (a) belongs to Rajakambala caste.\nIn his chief examination he says that he paid Rs. 200/ as 'parisam ' at the time of the marriage and paid Rs. 300/ as \"parisam ' for the marriage of his son and received Rs. 200/ as 'parisam ' for the marriage of his daughter.\nIn cross examination he says that on the betrothal day only one kalam of cumbu and cash are given to the bride 's party and that the Kambu is used by the bride 's people and that at the time of the marriage 3 or 4 marakkals of cumbu are again brought which is thrown over the bride and the bridegroom byway of blessing.\nHe adds that throwing of the kambu is a ritual in marriage ceremonies and that Kambu and cash are called \"Parisam '.\nThis evidence brings out the distinction between cash paid as the 'Parisam ' and Kambu brought to conform with the traditional ritual.\n274 R.W. 3 in the earlier suit whose evidence is marked as D. 317 says that he was a guru of the Rajakambala caste and that he performed the marriage of Moolipatti zamindar.\nHe further says that Kambu is taken by the bridegroom 's party to the bride 's house when the betrothal takes place and that seven pieces of jaggery, a cloth etc. are also taken and that no money is given in the caste.\nWe do not see how this evidence supports the practice of paying kambu as 'parisam '.\nindeed his evidence shows that Kambu is taken only as a part of the ritual and he is definite that no 'parisam ' is paid in the caste.\nRamasami Naicker Zamindar of Ammaianaickoor.\nwas examined in the previous suit and his evidence is marked as D 416.\nHe is definite in the chief examination that no 'parisam ' is paid in his community.\nHe says that it is rather undignified to receive 'Parisam ' and that he has not seen any parisam paid in his caste.\nWhether this witness is speaking truth or not, his evidence does not support the plaintiff.\nFrom the aforesaid evidence it is not possible to hold that either there is a practice in the Rajakambala family to give Kambu as 'parisam ' for the bride or kambu was paid as 'parisam ' at the time of the betrothal ceremony in connection with Bangaru Ammal 's marriage.\nReliance is placed upon Nelson 's Manual of the Madhura Country published in 1.865.\nAt page 82 of Part II in that /Manual the following passage appears : \"After this, the price of the bride, which consists usually of 7 kalams of kambu grain, is solemnly carried under a canopy of white cloth towards the house of the bride 's father 275 its approach being heralded by music and dancing.\nThe procession is met by the friends of the bride who receive the price, and allege together to the bride 's house.\n\" Similarly, in Thurston 's Castes and Tribes of Southern India published in 1902 in Volume VII under the heading 'Thotti Naickers ' at page 192, the following passage is given \"The bride price is 7 kalams of Kambu and the couple may cat only this grain and horsegram until the wedding is over.\n\" The evidence adduced in this case does not support the said statement.\nEven if those formalities are observed, they are only the relics of the past.\nThat practice represents only a symbolic ritual which.\nhas no bearing upon the reality of the situation.\nIndeed the witnesses in the present case realizing the ritualistic character of the said observances seek to base the case of the Plaintiffs on a more solid foundation but have miserably failed in their attempt.\nThese passage s therefore do not help the plaintiffs.\nThe next question is whether the expenditure for the marriage was incurred by the bridegroom 's party i. e. by the Mannarcottai Zamindar.\nThe learned Subordinate judge held on the evidence that Thevaram Zamindar spent a large amount of money for the marriage but the Mannarcottai Zamindar also spent a sum of Rs. 300/ or Rs. 575/ for the marriage expenses.\nHe expressed the view that if the matter was res integra, he would have held that the incurring of such an expenditure by the bridegroom 's party would not have made the marriage.\nan Asura marriage but felt bound by some of the decisions 276 of the Madras High Court to come to the opposite conclusion.\nThe learned judges of the High Court came to the conclusion that the marriage expenses in their entirety were borne by the Mannarcottai Zamindar and it must have been either in pursuance of the custom or arrangement among the community.\nThe evidence as regards the custom of the bride groom 's party incurring the expenses of the marriage is unconvinc ing.\nIndeed the learned counsel for the respondent does not rely upon custom but he prefers to base his case on the finding of the High Court that the entire marriage expenditure was incurred by the Mannarcottai zamindar.\nLet us now consider the evidence in this regard in some detail.\nP.W. 1 says in his evidence that Bangaru Ammal was the only child of the Thevaram Zamindar, that he was very affectionate to her and that he spent heavily for the marriage though he was not able to say how much he spent.\nP. W. 4 also says that Thevaram Zamindar gave her lot of jewels and finally gave her his entire estate.\nThe evidence that Thevaram Zamindar spent large amounts on the marriage and gave lot of jewels to Bangaru Ammal must be true, for even in 1895 when the marriage of Bangaru Ammal took place it is inconceivable that the marriage would have been celebrated with a few hundred rupees that was given by the Mannarcottai zamindar.\nHe must have spent much larger amount than that consistent with his status and position in life and particularly when he was celebrating the marriage of his only daughter.\nNow coming to the documentary evidence in support of the contention that Mannarcottai Zamindar met the entire expenditure, the respondents relied upon P. , P. and P. is a letter dated August 8, 1885, written by persons representing the Mannarcottai zamindar to the 277 Thevaram Zamindar office.\nTherein he stated :\"You should soon get ready there all the materials and samans for the shed and 'Panthal ' in connection with muhurtham.\nWe will start and come without fail\".\nThis letter does not show that Mannarcottai Zamindar gave the money for the materials and samans for the said 'Panthal '.\nIt was only an intima tion that everything should be made ready for the marriage as Mannarcottai people would be coming there without fail.\nExhibit P. 23 is the account of expenditure incurred on Bangammal 's marriage from 1.9.1895 to 5.9.1895.\nIt is said that it represents the amount spent on behalf of Mannarcottai zamindar and the amount recouped from him.\nThe document is not very clear.\nThe account does not appear to represent the entire expenditure incurred at the time of marriage because the entry about charges for pounding 50 kalams of paddy shows that 50 kalams of paddy must have been supplied from Thevaram stores and there is nothing on the account to show that 50 kalams were purchased on Mannarcottai account.\nBe that as it may this account only shows that Mannarcottai zamindar paid about Rs. 300/ but the learned counsel for the respondents argued relying upon exhibit P. 27 that even the balance of Rs. 295/14/in exhibit P. 23 shown as the excess amount spent by Thevaram Estate was paid off by the Mannarcottai zamindar to the Thevaram Zamindar.\nExhibit P. 27 is an entry dated September 30, 1885 in the account book of Thevaram Zamindar.\nIt show that the Maha raja meaning Thevaram Zamindar gave to Thevaram office Rs. 290.\nIt does not establish the respondent 's version.\nThe only merit of the contention is that the two figures approximate each other.\nIf that figure represents the amount paid by Mannarcottai Zamindar to Thevaram in full discharge of the amount due from the former to the latter, the entry would have run to the effect that the balance of the amount due from Mannarcottai under Ex.p.23 was paid and it would have been credited in Mannarcottai 278 account.\nIt may have been that the sum of Rs. 290/was the balance out of the amount that Thevaram Zamindar took with him when he went to Mannarcottai for meeting his expenditure.\nThe other accounts P. 25 and P. 26 filed in the case are neither full nor clear and no definite conclusion could be arrived at on the basis of the said account.\nWe therefore hold on the evidence and probabilities that Thevaram Zamindar had spent large amounts in connection with the marriage and Mannarcottai zamindar spent only about Rs. 300/ in connection with the said marriage.\nSuch a finding does not bring the marriage within the definition of Asura marriage as explained by us.\nearlier.\nThe expenditure incurred by the bridgegroom 's party was not and could not have been the consideration for the Thevaram Zamindar giving his daughter in marriage.\nIt is contended that the High Court found that there was no 'Kanyadhan ' at the time of the Bangaru Ammal 's marriage and as 'Kanyadhan ' was necessary ingredient of Brahmu marriage, Bangaru Ammal could not have been married in that form.\nThe High Court relying upon the evidence of Veluchami Naicker who is stated to be the Guru of the caste held that 'Kanyadhan ' had not been observed in Bangaru Ammal 's marriage.\nThe learned counsel for the appellant contests the correctness of the finding and he relies upon some invitations in support of his contention that 'Kanyadhan ' was observed in Bangaru Ammal 's marriage but the documents are not clear on the, point.\nThe Guru only narrates some of the ceremonies held in marriages in the community but he does not expressly state that the ceremony of 'Kanyadhan ' was not observed at Bangaru Ammal 's marriage.\nIn this state of evidence the presumption in.\nHindu Law that the marriage was performed in Brahmu form must be invoked.\nAs we have pointed out under the Hindu Law whether a marriage was in Brahmu form or Asura form the Court will presume 279 even where the parties are Shudras that it was in the Brahmu form.\nFurther where it is proved that the marriage was performed in fact the Court will also presume that the necessary ceremonies have been performed.\nSee 'Mauji Lal vs Chandrabati Kumari '(1).\nThis presumption has not been rebutted in this case.\nThat apart the argument of the learned counsel for the respondents mixes up an essential ingredient of the Brahmu marriage, namely the gift of the girl to the bridegroom with a particular form of ritual adopted for making such a gift.\nIn both forms of marriages a girl is given by father or in his absence by any other person entitled to give away the girl to the bridegroom.\nIn the case of Brahmu marriage it takes the form of a gift while in the case of Asura marriage as price is paid by the bridegroom, ,it takes the form of a sale.\nAs we have held that in Bangaru Ammal 's marriage no consideration passed from the bridegroom to the bride 's father, the father must be held to have made a gift of the girl to the bridegroom.\nTo put in other words there was 'Kanyadhan ' in Bangaru Ammal 's marriage.\nWe therefore reject this contention.\nLastly reliance is placed on the conduct of the appellant in not questioning the correctness of the finding given by the learned Subordinate judge in his application for delivery that the marriage was in Asura form.\nThe learned counsel for the appellant sought to explain his conduct but in our opinion nothing turns upon it.\nIf the marriage was not in Asura form as we held it was not, the conduct of the appellant could not possibly make it an Asura marriage.\nIn this view it is not necessary to give opinion on the other questions raised in the appeals.\nIn the result the decrees of the High Court are set aside and both the suits are dismissed with costs throughout.\nOne hearing fee.\nAppeals allowed (1) (1911) L.R. 38 I.A.122.\n",

Banerjee, Solicitor General, A.K. Ganguli and P. Parmeshwaran for the Appellant.\nA.T.M. Sampath for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J.\nThese are appeals under section 35L(b) of the (hereinafter called 'the Act ').\nThe respondents T.I. Millers Ltd. and T.I. Diamond Chain manufacture cycle lamps and automative chains.\nBoth these goods are assessable under Item 68 of the Central Excise Tariff.\nThe said respondents filed price lists for the sale of the goods through their distributors, namely, M/s. T.I. and M Sales Ltd., M/s. Charmvel Agencies and M/s. Ambadi Enterprises Pvt.\nLtd. quoting their price to the distributor as assessable value.\nHowever, subsequently following the decision of the Madras High Court in a valuation case, the respondents required that the price charged by them from buyers at the factory gate should be accepted as the assessable value and not the price to the distributors.\nThe question is whether the price charged by the respondents from buyers at the factory gate should be accepted as the assessable value for the levy of duty under section 3 of the Act.\nThe Assistant Collector found from the sales pattern of the respondents that the distributors were 'related persons ' as per section 4 of the Act and the price at which the distributors sold the goods should, therefore, be the assessable value.\nThe respondents went up in appeal before the Appellate Collector.\nThe Appellate Collector held that in order to establish mutuality of business interests, direct and indirect between manufacturer and buyer, it should be shown that they have been promoting the business of each other in their own interest and that in the absence of such a finding in the Assistant Collector 's order, these could not be held to be related persons.\nSection 4 of the Act provides that where the duty of excise is chargeable on any excisable goods with reference to value, such value should be determined on the basis of the normal price thereof, that is to say, the price at which such goods are ordinarily sold by the assessee to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal, where the buyer is not a related person and the price is the sole consideration for the sale.\nWe are not concerned for the purpose of these appeals with the provisos nor with sub section (2) or sub section (3) of section 4 of the Act.\nSub section 4(c) of section 4 defines 'related person ' to mean a person who is so 358 associated with the assessee that they have interest, direct or indirect, in the business of each other and includes a holding company, a subsidiary company, a relative and a distributor of the assessee, and any sub distributor of such distributor.\nThe explanation provides that 'holding company ', 'subsidiary company ' and 'relative ' have the same meanings as in the .\nThe words \"related person\" have been considered by this Court in Union of India and others vs Atic Industries Limited, ; Bhagwati, J., as the learned Chief Justice then was, speaking for the Court held that the first part of the definition of \"related person\" in clause (c) of sub section (4) of section 4 defines \"related person\" to mean \"a person who is so associated with the assessee that they have interest directly or indirectly in the business of each other\".\nIt is not enough, the Court observed, that the assessee has an interest, direct or indirect in the business of the person alleged to be a related person has an innough, that the person alleged to be a related person has an interest, direct or indirect in the business of the assessee.\nTo attract the applicability of the first part of the definition, it was observed, the assessee and the person alleged to be a related person must have interest, direct or indirect in the business of each other.\nEach of them must have a direct or indirect interest in the business of the other.\nThe quality and degree of interest which each has in the business of the other may be different, the interest of one in the business of the other may be direct while the interest of the latter in the business of the former may be indirect.\nThat would not make any difference so long as each has got some interest, direct or indirect in the business of the other.\nIn the notice issued by the Central Government seeking to review the Appellate Collector 's order, the Central Government indicated that there was an agreement existing between the respondents and their distributors according to which they were the company 's distributors for the sale of their goods.\nMajor portion of the sales were effected through M/s. T.I. and M Sales Ltd. who were the main distributors of M/s. Tube Investments of India Ltd. and its subsidiary companies and rest of the sales through the other two distributors.\nM/s. Tube Investment of India was the holding company of M/s. T.I. Millers Ltd. The agreement between the assessee and the T.I. and M Sales Ltd. was registered under the MRTP Act.\nThe Government of India also found that there was a territorial earmarking for the operation of the distributors, who also undertook advertisements and helped the sub dealers for maintaining show rooms in dealer 's pre 359 mises.\nThe distributors did not deal with competitor 's goods.\nThe Government of India also noted that the assessee granted mark up to the distributors to cover their establishment expenses, travelling expenses, advertisement and sundry expenses.\nOn these grounds, the Government of India tentatively considered that it was a fit case for reversing the order of the Appellate Collector who had held that the distributors were not related persons under section 4 of the Act.\nThe question is, whether the distributors in this case were related persons of the respondents and secondly, whether the expenses incurred for maintaining the show room, advertisements etc.\nshould also be added to the assessable value.\nHow the value should be computed has been examined by this Court in Union of India and others etc.\nvs Bombay Tyre International Ltd. etc.\n; , There, Pathak, J. as the learned Chief Justice then was, held that the definition of the words \"related person\" did not suffer from any constitutional infirmity.\nThis Court reiterated that on a true construction of its provisions in the context of the statutory scheme the old section 4(a) should be considered as applicable to the circumstances of the particular assessee himself and not of manufacturers generally.\nThe Court further reiterated that pursuant to the old section 4(a) the value of an excisable article for the purpose of the excise levy should be taken to be the price at which the excisable article is sold by the assessee to a buyer at arm 's length in the course of whole sale trade at the time and place of removal.\nWhere, however, the excisable article is not sold by the assessee in wholesale trade, but for example, is consumed by the assessee in his own industry the case is one where under the old section 4(a) the value must be determined as the price at which the excisable article or an article of the like kind and quality is capable of being sold in wholesale trade at the time and place of removal.\nThis Court analysed the position under the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944 as amended by Act XXII of 1973 that if the price at which the excisable goods are ordinarily sold by the assessee to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal as defined in sub section (4)(b) of section 4 is the basis for determination of excisable value provided, of course, the buyer is not a related person within the meaning of sub section (4)(c) of section 4 and the price is the sole consideration for the sale, that would be the value.\nThe proposition is subject to the terms of the three provisos to subsection (1)(a) of section 4.\nWhere the wholesale price of any excisable goods for delivery at the place of removal is not known and the value thereof is determined with reference to the wholesale price for delivery at a place other than the place of removal, the cost of transportation from the place of removal to the place of delivery should be 360 excluded from such price.\nIt was further held that these principles could not apply where the tariff value had been fixed in respect of any excisable goods under sub section (2) of section 3.\nThe Court also dealt with the interpretation of definition of 'related person '.\nThe Court further held that the expenses incurred on account of the several factors which have contributed to its value upto the date of sale, which apparently would be the date of delivery, are liable to be included.\nConsequently, where the sale is effected at the factory gate, expenses incurred by the assessee upto the date of delivery on account of storage charges, outward handling charges, interest on inventories (stocks carried by the manufacturer after clearance), charges for other services after delivery to the buyer, namely, after sales service and marketing and selling organisation expenses including advertisement expenses marketing and selling organisation expenses and after sales service promote the marketability of the article and enter into its value in the trade.\nWhere the sale in the course of wholesale trade is effected by the assessee through its sales organisation at a place or places outside the factory gate, the expenses incurred by the assessee upto the date of delivery under the aforesaid heads cannot, on the same grounds, be deducted.\nThe assessee will be entitled to a deduction on account of the cost of transportation of the excisable article from the factory gate to the place or places where it is sold.\nThe cost of transportation will include the cost of insurance on the freight for transportation of the goods from the factory gate to the place or places of delivery.\nThe new section 4(4)(d)(i) has made express provision for including the cost of packing in the determination of \"value\" for the purpose of excise duty.\nThe review application, by the change of law, was forwarded to the Tribunal.\nIt was contended before the Tribunal on behalf of the appellant that the distributors were related persons in terms of the judgment of this Court in Bombay Tyre International case (supra).\nOur attention was drawn to a letter dated 10th September, 1981 from the respondents to the Assistant Collector that the mark up allowed to the distributors was to cover their establishment expenses, advertisement, travelling expenses and he pointed out that this mark up included certain elements which have to be included in the assessable value.\nThe Tribunal held that according to the judgment of this Court in Bombay Tyre International case (supra) where the sale is effected at the factory gate, expenses incurred on account of charges for services after delivery to the buyer, namely after sale service and marketing and selling organisation expenses, including advertisement expenses could not be deducted from the assessable value.\nIt was further urged 361 on behalf of the appellant that other features like division of territory amongst the distributors and the marginal quantity of direct sales otherwise, as well as the fact that the distributors did not deal in competitor 's goods, clearly indicated that these are related persons.\nLearned Counsel drew our attention to the meaning of the term 'ordinarily ' given in K.G. Iyer 's Judicial Dictionary at page 704 and explained that it meant 'habitually ', or 'usually ', or 'normally '.\nIn this case, ordinarily sales are only through distributors and the sales are made by them on behalf of the manufacturer.\nLearned Counsel pointed out that this was a case where it was an extension of the manufacturer 's self to the point of sale by the distributor.\nLearned Counsel for the revenue urged that it was a case of indirect relationship and came within the ratio of the aforesaid decision of this Court in Bombay Tyre International case (supra).\nIn this case, it was highlighted that manufacturer had interest in the buyer who were their distributors and the distributors were only charging limited commission, maintained showrooms, and did not deal in the products of competitors of the manufacturer.\nIt was further contended that sales of their products as original equipment, could not be considered as sales in the ordinary course of wholesale trade.\nIt was further highlighted that the norm of inter connected undertakings found in MRTP Act is not relevant to decide 'related persons ' in the Act.\nIt was further argued that mere area restriction is not relevant for proving mutuality of interests, but it has to be shown that the sale was not at an arms length and but a principal to principal transaction.\nIt appears from the letter dated 10th September, 1981 from the appellants to the Department that the distributors paid for their own advertisements.\nIn some case, the manufacturer might release advertisements through the distributors.\nIt was also urged that even a sole distributor could be an independent buyer on behalf of the manufacturer and the distributor and in this connection reliance was placed on the observations of this A.K. Roy 's case S.C.).\nAfter sales service undertaken by the distributors was more in the nature of replacement of defective goods sold, which any manufacturer was bound to do and that is a normal essential service of a distributor.\nRegarding the 'mark up ' allowed by the manufacturer to the distributor as indicating special relationship, it was contended that it was provided for in the context of the requirement to indicate maximum selling price to be marked on the goods, and in fact, it was in this context that the appellants had made a reference to the MRTP Commission.\nThe Tribunal held that the distributors were not related persons and in the light of the observations of this Court in Atic In 362 dustries case (supra) set out hereinbefore.\nWe are of the opinion that what was necessary to find out, was whether the buyer is holding company or subsidiary company or relative of the manufacturer.\nFrom the explanation of the relationship furnished in this case, such is not the position.\nIt appears that the link between the respondents T.I.Miller Ltd. company and T.I. & M. Sales Ltd., is the main distributors of M/s. Tube Investments of India Ltd., who are the holding company of the respondents.\nThis relationship does not satisfy the criteria for establishing the related persons concept.\nThese were limited companies at the material time, and it will be difficult to say that a limited company has any interest direct or indirect in the business carried on by one of its shareholders.\nIt has been explained that the mark up in the price was allowed in connection with the requirement to display the maximum sale price.\nThe sales pattern shows also sales to other than distributors and it is not restricted only to the appointed distributors of T.I. India Limited.\nIn the premises the Tribunal 's upholding the order of the Appellate Collector, was right and correct.\nIn the background of the facts mentioned hereinbefore and in the light of the decisions of this Court in Bombay Tyre International and Atic Industries cases (supra), we are of the opinion that the Tribunal was right and there is no cause for interference with the order of the Tribunal.\nIn the premises, we decline to admit the appeals.\nH.S.K. Appeals dismissed.\n",

Iyer 's Judicial Dictionary at page 704 and explained that it meant 'habitually ', or 'usually ', or 'normally '.\nIn this case, ordinarily sales are only through distributors and the sales are made by them on behalf of the manufacturer.\nLearned Counsel pointed out that this was a case where it was an extension of the manufacturer 's self to the point of sale by the distributor.\nLearned Counsel for the revenue urged that it was a case of indirect relationship and came within the ratio of the aforesaid decision of this Court in Bombay Tyre International case (supra).\nIn this case, it was highlighted that manufacturer had interest in the buyer who were their distributors and the distributors were only charging limited commission, maintained showrooms, and did not deal in the products of competitors of the manufacturer.\nIt was further contended that sales of their products as original equipment, could not be considered as sales in the ordinary course of wholesale trade.\nIt was further highlighted that the norm of inter connected undertakings found in MRTP Act is not relevant to decide 'related persons ' in the Act.\nIt was further argued that mere area restriction is not relevant for proving mutuality of interests, but it has to be shown that the sale was not at an arms length and but a principal to principal transaction.\nIt appears from the letter dated 10th September, 1981 from the appellants to the Department that the distributors paid for their own advertisements.\nIn some case, the manufacturer might release advertisements through the distributors.\nIt was also urged that even a sole distributor could be an independent buyer on behalf of the manufacturer and the distributor and in this connection reliance was placed on the observations of this A.K. Roy 's case S.C.).\nAfter sales service undertaken by the distributors was more in the nature of replacement of defective goods sold, which any manufacturer was bound to do and that is a normal essential service of a distributor.\nRegarding the 'mark up ' allowed by the manufacturer to the distributor as indicating special relationship, it was contended that it was provided for in the context of the requirement to indicate maximum selling price to be marked on the goods, and in fact, it was in this context that the appellants had made a reference to the MRTP Commission.\nThe Tribunal held that the distributors were not related persons and in the light of the observations of this Court in Atic In 362 dustries case (supra) set out hereinbefore.\nWe are of the opinion that what was necessary to find out, was whether the buyer is holding company or subsidiary company or relative of the manufacturer.\nFrom the explanation of the relationship furnished in this case, such is not the position.\nIt appears that the link between the respondents T.I.Miller Ltd. company and T.I. & M. Sales Ltd., is the main distributors of M/s. Tube Investments of India Ltd., who are the holding company of the respondents.\nThis relationship does not satisfy the criteria for establishing the related persons concept.\nThese were limited companies at the material time, and it will be difficult to say that a limited company has any interest direct or indirect in the business carried on by one of its shareholders.\nIt has been explained that the mark up in the price was allowed in connection with the requirement to display the maximum sale price.\nThe sales pattern shows also sales to other than distributors and it is not restricted only to the appointed distributors of T.I. India Limited.\nIn the premises the Tribunal 's upholding the order of the Appellate Collector, was right and correct.\nIn the background of the facts mentioned hereinbefore and in the light of the decisions of this Court in Bombay Tyre International and Atic Industries cases (supra), we are of the opinion that the Tribunal was right and there is no cause for interference with the order of the Tribunal.\nIn the premises, we decline to admit the appeals.\nH.S.K. Appeals dismissed.\n",
    "key_points": [
      "found from the sales pattern of the respondents that the distributors were 'related persons ' as per section 4 of the Act and the price at which the distributors sold the goods should, therefore, be the assessable value.\nThe respondents went up in appeal before the Appellate Collector.\nThe Appellate Collector held that in order to establish mutuality of business interests, direct and indirect between manufacturer and buyer, it should be shown that they have been promoting the business of each other in their own interest and that in the absence of such a finding in the Assistant Collector 's order, these could not be held to be related persons.",
      "held that the first part of the definition of \"related person\" in clause (c) of sub section (4) of section 4 defines \"related person\" to mean \"a person who is so associated with the assessee that they have interest directly or indirectly in the business of each other\".\nIt is not enough, the Court observed, that the assessee has an interest, direct or indirect in the business of the person alleged to be a related person has an innough, that the person alleged to be a related person has an interest, direct or indirect in the business of the assessee.\nTo attract the applicability of the first part of the definition, it was observed, the assessee and the person alleged to be a related person must have interest, direct or indirect in the business of each other.",
      "found that there was a territorial earmarking for the operation of the distributors, who also undertook advertisements and helped the sub dealers for maintaining show rooms in dealer 's pre 359 mises.\nThe distributors did not deal with competitor 's goods.\nThe Government of India also noted that the assessee granted mark up to the distributors to cover their establishment expenses, travelling expenses, advertisement and sundry expenses."

Ltd. and the appellant herein, for supply of electrical energy to the latter 's hotel, inter alia, containing terms of rates, discounts, minimum sum payable and increase in the rates and sums payable once a year on account of increase in cost of production and distribution of electrical energy.\nClause 9 of the said agreement contained terms of the rate of supply and the contingencies in which such rates could be increased.\nThe said Clause provided as follows: PG NO. 674 \"The consumer shall, subject to the provisions hereinafter contained, pay to the Company for all electrical energy supplied and registered or estimated as herein provided at the rate of Rs.0.20 (Rupees zero decimal two zero) per unit per month for all energy so supplied and registered and/or estimated in the case of a defective meter installation in accordance with the proviso to clause 6 thereof.\nThe charge for all energy shall be subject to the scale of special discounts in accordance with the schedule annexed thereto.\nProvided that, (without regard to the quantity of units supplied) if the payment made or to be made for any one English Calendar year ending 31st March in respect of the electricity consumed shall fall short of a minimum sum of Rs. 38640 (Rs. Thirty eight thousand six hundred and forty) the consumer shall nevertheless pay to the Company such amount in addition to the payments already made in respect of the electricity consumed for such Calendar year as will, being the total payment made in this respect to the said minimum of Rs.38640 (Rs.

Ltd. will continue to be in force with the respondent until such time the agreement is determined in accordance with its relevant provisions.\nAll bills received subsequent to the take over were billed at the agreed rate allowing discounts and rebates.\nOn or about 23rd November, 1974, the appellant received a communication from the respondent informing that uniform PG NO 676 tariff rates issued under section 49 of the Electricity Supply Act, 1949 will be applicable to the electrical energy supplied to the hotel w.e.f.\n12.10.1974.\nSection 49 of the (hereinafter called `the Act '), is to the following effect: \"49.\nProvision for the sale of electricity by the Board to persons other than licensees.\n(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and of regulations, if any, made in this behalf, the Board may supply electricity to any person not being a licensee upon such terms and conditions as the Board thinks fit and may for the purposes of such supply frame uniform tariff.\n(2) In fixing the uniform tariffs, the Board shall have regard to all or any of the following factors, namely: (a) the nature of supply and the purposes for which it is required: (b) the co ordinated development of the supply and distribution of electricity within the State in the most efficient and economical manner, with particular reference to such development in areas not for the time being served or adequately served by the licensee: (c) the simplification and standardisation of methods and rates of charge for such supplies; (d) the extension and cheapening of supplies of electricity to sparsely developed areas.\n(3) Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this section shall derogate from the power of the Board, if it considers it necessary or expedient to fix different tariffs for the supply of electricity to any person not being a licensee, having regard to the geographical position or any area, the nature of the supply, and purpose for which supply is required and any other relevant factors.\n(4) In fixing the tariff and terms and conditions for the supply of electricity, the Board shall not show undue preference to any person.\n\" PG NO.\n677 After the said date the bills were sent at the enhanced rate of 0.30 P per unit, adding fuel cost variation charges and without allowing any discount or rebate.\nOn or about 28th November, 1974, the appellant, however, protested against the unilateral withdrawal of contractual discount and rebates and enhancement in the rates and drew the attention of the respondent to the existing and subsisting bulk supply agreement, but the respondent took no action.\nOn or about 31st August, 1976, a Circular was issued by the Chief Engineer of the respondent advising all Engineers in charge of the undertakings to bill the consumers having special agreements with the ex licensees as per those agreements and steps be taken to terminate the old agreements with new agreements providing for application of tariff.\nOn 7th October, 1977, vide written communication the appellant informed the respondent that upon latter 's failure to resolve the disputes and differences arising between them consequent to the illegal increase in the rates and discontinuation of discounts and rebates w.e.f.\n12.10.1974, the appellant was referring the disputes for decision by the arbitrator and appointed Justice Manchanda, a retired Judge of the Allahabad High Court, as the arbitrator and the respondent appointed Justice Nigam, another retired Judge of the same High Court, as its arbitrator.\nOn or about 8th April, 1977, the joint arbitrators appointed Justice V. Bhargava, a retired Judge of this Court, as an Umpire.\nBetween 3rd November, 1979 and 4th March, 1980, several sittings were held before the arbitrators but the parties were unable to agree and upon their disagreement the disputes were referred to the learned Umpire for decision.\nFrom 4th March, 1980 onwards, proceedings started before the Umpire and there was a plea for de novo hearing of the proceedings before the Umpire, by the respondent.\nThe learned Umpire started de novo proceedings taking evidence of the parties.\nOn 21st March, 1980, the respondent filed an application, being Case No. 59 of 1980 under section 33 of the before the District Judge, Lucknow, denying the existence of the agreement dated 20th October, 1962.\nThe respondent also denied the acceptance and adoption of the agreement consequent upon the take over and sought a declaration from the Court that the arbitration agreement did not exist.\nThe Vth Addl.\nDistrict Judge by his order dated 27.5.1983 held that the agreement was duly executed, accepted and adopted by the respondent and was binding on it and that the arbitration proceedings were pursuant to the arbitration clause and, as such, the application under section 33 of the , was rejected.\nPG NO.\n678 On 1st June, 1983, the award was made by the learned Umpire holding that in terms of clause 9 the increase in the unit rate was permissible and the fuel cost variation charges which were variable every month was contrary to clause 9 as increase was permitted only once in a year of accounts, and further held that the appellant was entitled to discount of 50% on the charges for electricity; and was also entitled to 0.03 paise per rupee for prompt payment of bills.\nThe learned Umpire in his award set out the facts and therein recited these as follows: \"The main terms of the agreement were that in respect of the bulk electric supply to the petitioner the Hotel was to be charged at the rate of twenty paise per unit per month.\nThere was also a clause for granting a special discount to the petitioner to the extent of 50% and in addition a cash discount of three paise per whole rupee was to be allowed to the petitioner in case the petitioner paid the bills of the Company within the stipulated period.\nThe bills for the electric energy supplied by the Supply Company continued on these contractual rates till October 1974, even after the Supply Company was acquired by the opposite party in December 1973, and the bills were accordingly paid.\nHowever, in October 1974, the opposite party under section 49 of the (hereinafter referred to as the Act) unilaterally and according to the petitioner illegally and arbitrarily purported to replace the original terms in the agreement and revised the charges with effect from 12th October, 1974.\nThe Board, under this notification, increased the rate of electricity supplied to 30 paise per unit and further refused to grant the discount to which the petitioner was entitled under the agreement as well as the cash discount of three paise per rupee.\nThe opposite party further levied a fuel cost adjustment charges and subsequently the rate was raised to 31 paise per unit with effect from June 1976.\n\" Thereafter, the learned Umpire set out the history of the negotiations between the parties resulting in the agreement dated 20.10.1962.\nAfter referring to the bulk supply agreement the learned arbitrator set out the terms upon which supply was made to the appellant.\nThe appellant was to make an initial payment of Rs.35,326 towards service connection for the purpose of supply, though irrespective of PG NO 679 the payment the service connection was to continue to be the property of the Supply Company.\nThe Supply Company was to make provision in the appellant 's monthly bill granting a rebate of Rs. 147.20 for each month that the agreement remained inforce upto a maximum of 20 years.\nUnder para 9 of the agreement the appellant was to pay the Company for all electric energy supplied, registered, and estimated at the rate of 20 paise p.m.\nThe charges for energy consumed were subject to special discount according to the scale in the schedule which permitted a maximum discount of 50% in case a minimum of 41,000 units were consumed in each month.\nThe consumption as shown by the record was never less than 41,000 units p.m.\nIn addition, there was a provision under clause (ii) of the agreement for cash discount of 3 paise per whole rupee in case payment was made within the stipulated period.\nUnder the first proviso to para 9, the appellant had to pay a minimum sum of Rs.38,640 for electricity consumed in any English calendar year.\nThe provision made was that in addition to the amount paid in accordance with the bills, the appellant was to make payment in such cases so as to make up the said minimum of Rs.38,640.\nThe second proviso laid down that if and whenever during the subsistence of the agreement the Supply Company was satisfied that there was an increase in the cost of production and distribution of electric energy it shall be at liberty (but not more than once a year) to increase the rates and sums payable by the consumer under the provisions of clause 9 by such amount as the Company shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, decide.\nHence, it was held by the Umpire on the oral and documentary evidence that the payment was made at the enhanced rate under protest.\nChallenging the Award, several contentions were raised, namely, (i) that there was no agreement in existence and that neither the Umpire nor the arbitrator had any jurisdiction to make the award.\nThis contention was rejected and no argument was advanced before us challenging this finding of the Umpire, (ii) that the appellant should prove the terms and conditions upon which the Supply Company was supplying the electricity to the appellant.\nThis the Umpire held, had been duty proved and there was no challenge to either of the findings of the Umpire.\n(iii) it was thirdly contended that the agreement even if in existence, was not binding upon the respondent.\nand that while admitting that the respondent under section 49 of the Act, issued Notification under which the tariff was revised w.e.f.\n12.10.1974, it was claimed that the opposite party had not, in any way, failed to fulfil its obligations on the alleged agreement and that the opposite party was fully competent under law to fix a uniform tariff and also to levy fuel PG NO 680 adjustment charges.\nThis is the main and substantial question involved in this matter.\nIt was then contended that the respondent was entitled even under the agreement and under its second proviso to clause 9 to revise the tariff and the appellant was not entitled to any relief.\nIt was further urged that the payments were made after coming into operation of the , under protest.\nIn respect of these contentions the learned Umpire held that the plea was that even if the agreement was in existence, it was not binding on the opposite party and that the opposite party was competent under section 49 of the Electricity Supply Act, to fix revised charges w.e.f.\n12.10.1974 and had not violated any terms of the agreement.\nThe appellant had also relied on the alternative provisions of section 49(3) of the Act, set out hereinbefore.\nThe said sub section (3) provides that nothing contained in sub sections (1) & (2) of section 49 shall derogate from the power of the Board, if it happens to enter into an agreement at different rates of tariff with any person other than a licensee.\nIt appears that when the Supply Company was taken over on l7/18.12.1973, the resident Engineer wrote a letter on 16.1.1974 in which he informed the appellant that the licence of M/s. Agra Electric Supply Co. Ltd. having expired and the U.P. State Electricity Board having taken over the supply, it was to supply energy to the appellant at the aforesaid date.\nTheir further contention was that the bulk supply agreement which the appellant had with M/s. Agra Electric Supply Co. Ltd., would continue to be in force with the State Electricity Board until such time as the agreement was determined in accordance with the relevant provisions thereof.\nThe learned Umpire held that the letter clearly laid down that the U.P. Electricity Board had accepted the agreement which was in existence between the Supply Company and the appellant, and the Umpire proceeded on that basis.\nThe learned Umpire further stated as follows: \"The Board thus having accepted the agreement with the claimant, it became binding on the Board and under sub section (3) of section 49 of the Electric Supply Act nothing contained in sub sections (1) & (2) of section 49 of the Act could have any bearing on the terms of the agreement.\nThe result was that the uniform tariff fixed by the Board with effect from 12th October, 1974 did not apply to the claimant and the claimant had to be granted the various rebates laid down in the agreement.\nThe decision of the Supreme Court in Indian Aluminium Co. Ltd. vs Kerala Electricity Board, PG NO 681 [1976] 1 SCR pa.\n70 fully covers the case and supports the claim of the claimant.\nIn the case before the Supreme Court an agreement had been entered into by the State Government and it was held that under section 60 of the Electricity Supply Act, 1940 it became binding on the Kerala State Electricity Board and further that that agreement was enforceable under sub section (3) of s 49 irrespective of the fixation of uniform tariff under sub sections (I) and (2) of section 49.\nIn the present case the only difference is that instead of the agreement being first binding between the consumer and the State Government, the agreement became binding on the Electricity Board, because it accepted the agreement and became a party to it by letter dated 16th January 1974 (exhibit R).\n\" The aforesaid basis of the decision, it was contended, was the error of law which vitiated the award.\nThis question will require further consideration later.\nIt was held that the decision in Indian Aluminium Co., (supra) fully covered the dispute on this aspect in the instant case.\nThe learned Umpire further held as follows: \"Once the agreement was binding on the Board its terms under sub section (3) of section 49 could not be varied by fixation of uniform tariff under sub sections (1) and (2) of section 49.\nThe opposite party in these circumstances must be held to have failed to fulfil its obligations under the agreement\".\nOn 1st July, 1983.\nan application was made under section 12 [2] of the before the learned District Judge, Lucknow, for filing of the award and making the same Rule of the Court.\nObjections were filed by the respondent against the said award.\nThe learned kind Addl.\nDistt.\nJudge, Lucknow, held that the award was legal, valid and binding on the parties and the alleged grounds of misconduct were not maintainable.\nThe award was.\nhowever, set aside on the ground that the reference made to arbitration was unilateral.\nThe appellant filed an appeal.\nThe Lucknow Bench of the Allahahad High Court held against the finding of the Ilnd Additional Distt.\nJudge Lucknow that the reference was unilateral.\nbut set aside the award on the ground that there was an error of law apparent on the face of it in view of the agreement dated 20.10. 1962 and the ratio of the decision of this Court in Indian Aluminium Co., (supra).\nThe revision filed by the respondent against the judgment of the Vth Addl.\nDistt Judge, Lucknow was also rejected.\nThis appeal is from the aforesaid decision of the High Court by special leave.\nPG NO 682 The two learned Judges of the High Court gave separate judgments.\nThe High Court was of the view that the instant case was distinct from the facts in the case of Indian Aluminium Co., (supra).\nThere it was held that where a stipulation in a contract is entered into by a public authority in exercise of a statutory power then, even though such stipulation fetters subsequent exercise of the same statutory power, it would be valid and the exercise of such statutory power would pro tanto stand restricted.\nMr Justice Loomba was of the view that in the instant case even if the stipulation as to the tariff structure in the agreement by taken to have been continued to be in existence in view of sub section (3) of section 49 of the Act, the same was not unrestricted.\nThe stipulation was expressly made subject to certain reservations as would be clear from the opening sentence of clause 9 of the agreement, the main clause was \"subject to the provisions hereinafter contained\".\nMr Justice Loomba was of the view that the decision of the Indian Aluminium Co., (supra) case was inapplicable to the present case.\nAccording to the learned Judge, the mistake committed by the Umpire was a manifest error.\nIt was further stated that it is well settled proposition of law that if the reasons are stated on the basis of which the award was made and such reasons are found to be erroneous, the errors become apparent on the face of the award and constitute legal misconduct on the part of the Umpire vitiating the award.\nThe other learned Judge Mr Justice Mathur also held that there was error of law apparent on the face of the award of the Umpire.\nHe was of the opinion that the expression \"sum payable by the consumer under the foregoing provision of this present clause 9\" was subject to the discounts mentioned in the subsequent clauses of the agreement.\nIn view of the discounts, the sum payable under clause 9 was altered and the altered amount becomes the sum payable under clause 9.\nAccording to the learned Judge, since the amount determined after allowing discounts is also sum payable under clause 9, it followed that in exercise of the power conferred under the third proviso, the discount could only be tampered with in the same way the unit charge could be tampered with.\nBeyond this it was not permissible.\nIn permitting this the Umpire committed an error in drawing distinction between 'rates ' and 'discount ' and upholding the right of the Board to tamper with the former and negating similar right in respect of the latter.\nAccording to the learned Judge, this was a wrong understanding of the decision of the Indian Aluminium 's case (supra).\nIn the aforesaid view of the matter, the learned Judge agreed with the other learned Judge and held that the award was vitiated.\nPG NO 683 It appears that the main question that arises is: whether the decision of this Court in Indian Aluminium 's case (supra) was properly understood and appreciated by the learned Umpire and whether he properly applied the agreement between the parties in the light of the aforesaid decision.\nIt was contended that the question was whether the sums payable under clause 9 included discounts.\nOn the aforesaid basis it was contended that there was an error of law and such error was manifest on the face of the award.\nEven assuming, however, that there was an error of construction of the agreement or even that there was an error of law in arriving at a conclusion, such an error is not an error which is amenable to correction even in a reasoned award under the law.\nReference may be made to the observations of this Court in Coimbatore Distt.\nP.T. Sangam vs Bala Subramania Foundry, AlR , where it was reiterated that an award can only be set aside if there is an error on its face.\nFurther, it is an error of law and not mistake of fact committed by the arbitrator which is justiciable in the application before the Court.\nWhere the alleged mistakes or errors, if any, of which grievances were made were mistakes of facts if at all, and did not amount to error of law apparent on the face of the record, the objections were not sustainable and the award could not be set aside.\nSee also the observations of this Court in Delhi Municipal Corpn.\nvs M/S. Jagan Nath Ashok Kumar, ; , where this Court reiterated that reasonableness of the reasons given by an arbitrator in making his award cannot be challenged.\nIn that case before this Court, there was no evidence of violation of any principle of natural justice, and in this case also there is no violation of the principles of natural justice.\nIt may be possible that on the same evidence some court might have arrived at some different conclusion than the one arrived at by the arbitrator but that by itself is no ground for setting aside the award of an arbitrator.\nAlso see the observations of Halsbury 's Laws of England, 4th Edn., Vol. 2, at pages 334 & 335, para 624, where it was reiterated that an arbitrator 's award may be set aside for error of law appearing on the face of it, though that jurisdiction is not lightly to be exercised.\nIf a specific question of law is submitted to the arbitrator for his decision and he decides it, the fact that the decision is erroneous does not make the award bad on its face so as to permit it being set aside; and where the question referred for arbitration is a question of construction, which is, generally speaking, a question of law, the arbitrator 's decision cannot be set aside only because the court would itself have come to a different conclusion; but if it appears on the face of the award that the arbitrator has proceeded illegally, as, for instance, by deciding on evidence which was not admissible, or on principles of construction which the law does not PG NO 684 countenance, there is error in law which may be ground for setting aside the award.\nIt was contended by Mr F.S. Nariman, counsel for the appellant, that a specific question of law being a question of construction had been referred to the Umpire and, hence, his decision, right or wrong, had to be accepted.\nIn view of clause 18, it was submitted that in this case a specific reference had been made in the interpretation of the agreement between the parties, hence, the parties were bound by the decision of the Umpire.\nOur attention was drawn to the observations of this Court in M/s. Hindustan Tea Co. vs M/s. K. Sashikant & Co., AIR 1987 SC 81, where this Court held that under the law, the arbitrator is made the final arbiter of the dispute between the parties, referred to him.\nThe award is not open to challenge on the ground that the arbitrator has reached a wrong conclusion or has failed to appreciate facts.\nWhere the award which was a reasoned one was challenged on the ground that the arbitrator had acted contrary to the provisions of section 70 of the Contract Act, it was held that the same could not be set aside.\nIn order to set aside an award, there must be a wrong proposition of law laid down in the award as the basis of the award.\nFor this see the observations of this Court in Kanpur Nagar Mahapalika vs M/s.\nNarain Das Haribansh, In that case the appellant had entered into a contract with the respondent for certain construction work.\nThe contract contained an arbitration agreement between the parties.\nThe respondent filed a suit in 1946 claiming certain moneys due against its final bills but, at the instance of the appellant, the suit was stayed and the matter referred to arbitration.\nThe arbitrator made an award in March 1960 in favour of the plaintiffs determining the amount payable by the appellant.\nThereafter the appellant made an application for setting aside the award on the ground that the arbitrator had misconducted himself in not properly considering that the claim of the respondent was barred by limitation under section 326 of the U.P. Act 2 of 1916.\nAlthough the trial court set aside the award, the High Court, in appeal, reversed this decision.\nIn appeal to this Court it was contended for the appellant that the award was bad by reason of an error apparent on its face.\nDismissing the appeal, it was held that there could not be predicated of the award that there was any proposition of law forming the basis of the award, and, therefore, it could not be said that there was any error apparent on the face of the award.\nPG NO 685 The Judicial Committee in the famous decision of Champsey Bhara & Co. vs Jivraj Balloo Spinning & Weaving Co. Ltd., [ held that the error of law on the face of the award means that one can find in the award or in document incorporated thereto as, for instance, a note appended by the arbitrator stating the reasons for his judgment, some legal proposition which is the basis of the award and which is erroneous.\nThe same view was reiterated by this Court in Dr. S.B. Dutt vs University of Delhi, ; In this case.\nMr. Nariman appearing for the appellant contended that there was no proposition of law as such stated by the Umpire which could be said to be the basis of his decision.\nHence, the award was not amenable to corrections on the ground that there was an error of law apparent on its face.\nMr. Nariman further submitted that the Umpire had decided the specific question of law and such a decision, right or wrong, is binding on the parties.\nIn aid of his submission Mr. Nariman referred to the decision of this Court in M/s. Kapoor Nilokheri Co op.\nDairy Farm Society Ltd. vs Union of India & Ors., [ , where it was held that in a case of arbitration where the appellants had sepcifically stated that their claims were based on the agreement and on nothing else and all that the arbitrator had to decide was as to the effect of an agreement between the appellant and the respondent, the arbitrator had really to decide a question of law i.e. of interpreting the document, the agreement.\nSuch a decision his, is not open to challenge.\nOur attention was drawn to the observations of this Court in Tarapore & Co. vs Cochin Shipyard Lld.\nCochin & Anr., [l984] 3 SCR 118, where Desai J., spoke for the Court and Justice Chinnappa Reddy agreed with him.\nIt was stated that a question of law might figure before an arbitrator in two ways.\nIt may arise as an incidental point while deciding the main dispute referred to the arbitrator or in a given case parties may refer a specific question of law to the arbitrator for his decision.\nThis Court reiterated that the arbitration has been considered a civilised way of resolving disputes avoiding court proceedings.\nThere was no reason why the parties should be precluded from referring a specific question of law to an arbitrator for his decision and agree to be bound by the same.\nThis approach manifests faith of parties in the capacity of the tribunal of their choice to decide even a pure question of law.\nIf they do so, with eyes wide open, there is nothing to preclude the parties from doing so.\nIf a question of law is specifically referred and it becomes evident that the parties desired to have a decision on the specific question from the arbitrator rather than one from the Court, then the court will not interfere PG NO 686 with the award of the arbitrator on the ground that there was an error or law apparent on the face of the award even if the view of law taken by the arbitrator did not accord with the view of the court.\nA long line of decisions was relied upon by this Court for that proposition.\nMr. B. Sen, learned counsel for the respondent, however, contended that in the present case, there was no specific question of law referred to the Umpire.\nHe submitted that it was a general reference in which a question of law arose.\nIt was any question in the proceedings and the question of law, as such, did not arise.\nAccording to Mr. Sen, the mistake that the Umpire, has committed is clear from his following statement: \"The Board thus having accepted the agreement with the claimant, it became binding on the Board and under sub section [3] of section 49 of the Electricity Supply Act nothing contained in sub section ( 1) & (2) of section 49 of the Act could have any bearing on the terms of the agreement.\nThe result was that the uniform tariff fixed by the Board with effect from 12th October, 1974 did not apply\".\nIt was stated that no specific question having been referred to, this mistake was fatal.\nWe are unable to accept this submission.\nOur attention was drawn by Mr. Nariman to the observations of Justice Macnaghten in Hitchins & Anr.\nvs British Coal Refining Processes Ltd., [1936] 2 A.E.R. Reprint 191.\nIhere, by an agreement the applicants were to act as consulting Engineers in connection with a certain coal refining process owned by the respondents.\nWhile the plant for the working of the process was being erected, a dispute arose.\nthe respondents wanting the applicants to attend every day at the site of the plant and the applicants considering this to be no part of their duty.\nThe respondents thereupon terminated the agreement and the matter was referred to arbitration.\nThe applicants pleaded that the termination of the agreement was unjustified; the respondents pleaded that the applicants should have attended every day and that they had been quilty of negligence in respect of certain matters set out in the counterclaim.\nThe arbitrator found the termination of the agreement to be unjustified and also negligence on the part of the appellants in respect of the matters set out in the counterclaim, and he awarded the appellants damages after setting off an unspecified amount for damages for negligence.\nThe respondents moved to set aside the award on PG NO 687 the ground of error of law apparent on the face of it.\nAt the hearing the respondents contended that the whole of the pleadings in the arbitration were admissible.\nThe respondents contended that for the purpose of deciding whether there was an error of law apparent on the face of the award, the court could not look at any document except the award itself.\nThe respondents further contended that the arbitrator had committed an error of law in deciding that the negligence found did not afford sufficient ground for the termination of the agreement, and further that on the true consideration of the agreement, the refusal to attend daily was as a matter of law a sufficient ground for the termination of the agreement.\nIt was held that inasmuch as the arbitrator in his award referred to certain paragraphs in the counterclaim, such paras ought, in considering whether there was an error on the face of the award, to be regarded as forming part of the award.\nWhether misconduct justifies dismissal is a question of fact, and the arbitrator 's decision was final.\nIt was further held that the light to terminate the agreement because the applicants refused to attend daily was a question specifically submitted to the arbitrator and the court could not interfere with his decision, even if the question was a question of law.\nMr. Justice Macnaghten at page 195 of the report observed that it was permissible to look at the whole of the pleadings delivered in the arbitration, and it appears therein that the respondents affirmed and the applicants denied that the respondents were entitled to terminate the agreement as the applicants refused to attend daily at the site, and that this was a specific question submitted to the decision of the arbitrator.\nOur attention was also drawn to the observations of House of Lords in Pioneer Shipping Ltd. and Ors.\nvs ETP Tioxide Ltd., In that case by a charterparty dated 2nd November, 197 the owners of a vessel chartered her to the charterers.\nIt was held by the House of Lords that having regard to the purpose the Arbitration Act, 1970 of England which was to promote greater finality in arbitration awards then had been the case under the special case procedure judicial interference with the arbitrator 's award was only justified if it was shown that the arbitrator had misdirected himself in law or had reached a decision which no reasonable arbitrator could have.\nIn the instant case, the view taken by the Umpire on the interpretation of the agreement between the parties in the light of the observations of this Court in Indian Aluminium Co. 's case (supra) was at best a possible view to take, if not the correct view.\nIf that was the position then such a view, even if wrong, cannot be corrected by this Court on the basis6is of long line of decisions of this Court.\nIn the PG NO 688 aforesaid view of the matter it is necessary to examine the aforesaid decision in the Indian Aluminium Co 's case (supra).\nThere under section 49(1) & (2) of the Electricity Supply Act, 1948, the Legislature had empowered the State Electricity Board to frame uniform tariffs and had also indicated the factors to be taken into account in fixing uniform tariffs.\nUnder sub section (3), the Board was empowered, in the special circumstances mentioned therein, to fix different tariffs for the supply of electricity, but in doing so, sub section (4) directed that the Board was not to show undue preference to any person.\nUnder section 59 it was stipulated that the Board shall not, as far as practicable, carry on its operations at a loss and shall adjust its charges accordingly from time to time.\nCertain consumers of electricity had entered into agreements for the supply of electricity for their manufacturing purposes at specified rates for specified period.\nSome of the agreements were entered into with the State Governments and the others with the State Electricity Boards.\nIn one of the agreements there was an arbitration clause.\nOn account of the increase in the operation and maintenance cost, due to various causes which caused loss to the State Electricity Boards, the Boards wanted to increase the charges in all the cases.\nThe consumers challenged the competency of the Boards to do so by petitions in the respective High Courts.\nThe High Court sustained the Board 's claim, in some cases, under sections 49 & 59, and in others, held that the Board was incompetent to do so.\nIn the case of the consumer where there was the arbitration clause.\nthe High Court refused to entertain the petition on account of the clause.\nThis Court held that fixation of special tariffs under section 49 (3) can be a unilateral Act on the part of the Board but more often it is the result of negotiations between the Board and the consumer and hence a matter of agreement between them.\nTherefore, the Board can, in exercise of the power conferred under the sub section, enter into an agreement with a consumer stipulating for special tariff for supply of electricity for a specific period of time.\nThe agreements for supply of electricity to the consumers must therefore he regarded as having been entered into by the Boards in exercise of the statutory power conferred under section 49(3).\nThe Umpire in his award stated that the decision of this Court covered and supported the claim of the claimant.\nIn the present case the only difference is that there was only an agreement by which the Electricity Board accepted the agreement which was held by the Umpire to have become operative.\nOnce that agreement was binding on the Board, its terms could not be varied from the uniform rate under sub sections (1) and (2) of section 49.\nThe Umpire was right.\nIn our opinion, the Umpire committed no error in arriving at such conclusion.\nFurthermore, such a conclusion is certainly a possible view of the interpretation of the decision of this PG NO 689 Court in Indian Aluminium Co 's case, if not the only view.\nWe need go no further than that.\nWe, are, therefore, of the opinion that the view taken by the Umpire on section 49 was a possible view in the light of the decision of this Court in Indian Aluminium 's case.\nIn the premises, a question of law arose certainly during the course of the proceedings.\nSuch a question has been decided by the Umpire on a view which is a possible one to take.\nEven if there was no specific reference of a question of law referred to the Umpire, there was a question of law involved.\nEven on the assumption that such a view is not right, the award is not amenable to interference or correction by the courts of law as there is no proposition of law which could be said to be the basis of the award of the Umpire, and which is erroneous.\nIn the premises, we are of the opinion that the High Court and the learned IInd Additional District Judge were in error in the view they took of the award of the Umpire.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be allowed and the decision of the High Court, dated 21st July, 1987 as well as the order of the IInd Additional Judge, Lucknow, dated 30th May, 1984 are set aside.\nNo other point was urged challenging the award of the Umpire.\nThe award of the Umpire is confirmed and let the award be made Rule of the Court under section 14(2) of the Act.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs.\nR.S.S. Appeal allowed.\n",
    "summary": "On taking over the Agra Electric Supply Co. in December 1973, the respondent U.P. State Electricity Board intimated to the appellant U.P. Hotels that the Bulk Supply Agreement between the appellant and the Agra Electric Supply Co. would continue to be in force until such time the agreement was determined in accordance with its relevant provisions.\nThe agreement contained terms of rates, discounts, minimum sum payable and increase in the rates and sums payable once a year on account of increase in cost of production and distribution of electrical energy (clause 9) and also contained an arbitration clause (clause 18).\nIn November 1976, the appellant received a communication from the respondent informing that the uniform tariff rates issued under section 49 of the Electricity Supply Act, 1949 would be applicable to them.\nThe Board also withdrew the contractual discount and rebates.\nWhile sub sections (1) and (2) of section 49, stipulate a uniform tariff for electric supply, sub section (3) authorises the Board to fix different tariffs for the supply of electricity.\nThe appellant protested against this unilateral increases and withdrawal, but without success.\nThe appellant then informed the respondent that it was referring the disputes for decision by the arbitrator and appointed a retired High Court Judge as its arbitrator.\nThe respondent in turn appointed another retired High Court Judge as a joint arbitrator.\nThe joint arbitrators appointed Justice V. Bhargava, a retired Judge of the Supreme Court, as the Umpire.\nThe arbitrators having failed, the proceedings started before the Umpire.\nThe Umpire gave his award in June 1983 and held that the Board having accepted the agreement, it became binding on the Board and once the agreement was binding, its terms under sub section (3) of section 49 could not be varied by PG NO 670 PG NO 671 fixation of uniform tariff under sub sections (1) and (2).\nThe Umpire further held that the present case was fully covered by the decision of the Supreme Court in Indian Aluminium Co. wherein it was held that where a stipulation in a contract was entered into by a public authority in exercise of a statutory power then, even though such stipulation fettered subsequent exercise of the same statutory power, it would be valid and the exercise of such statutory power would pro tanto stand restricted.\nIn that view of the matter the Umpire held that in terms of clause 9 the increase in unit rate was permissible and the fuel cost variation charges which were variable every month was contrary to clause 9 as increase was permitted only once in a year of accounts, and further that the appellant was entitled to discount of 50% of the charges for electricity and also to discount for prompt payment of bills.\nObjections were filed by the respondent before the IInd Additional District Judge during the proceedings initiated for making the award the Rule of the Court.\nThe IInd Additional Distt.\nJudge set aside the award on the ground that the reference made to arbitration was unilateral.\nIn appeal, the High Court, while holding against the above finding of the IInd Addl.\nJudge, set aside the award on the ground that the Indian Aluminium Co. case was inapplicable to the present case, and the mistake committed by the Umpire in this regard was error of law apparent on the face of the award.\nThe High Court held that even if the stipulation as to the tariff structure in the agreement be taken to have been Continued in existence in view of sub section (3) of section 49 of the Act, the same was not unrestricted, and that the stipulation was expressly made subject to certain reservations as would be clear from the opening sentence of clause 9 of the agreement the main clause was \"subject to the provisions hereinafter contained\".\nIt was further held that in drawing distinction between `rates ' and `discount ' and upholding the right of the Board to tamper with the former and negating similar right in respect of the latter, the Umpire had committed an error.\nBefore this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that a specific question of law being a question of construction had been referred to the Umpire and hence, his decision, right or wrong, had to be accepted.\nOn behalf of the respondent it was contended that there was no specific question of law referred to the Umpire but it was a general reference in which a question of law arose, and that it was a question in the proceedings and the question of law, as such, did not arise.\nPG NO. 672 Allowing the appeal, it was, HELD: (1) Even assuming that there was an error of construction of the agreement or even that there was an error of a law in arriving at a conclusion, such an error was not an error which was amenable to correction even in a reasoned award under the law.\n[683B] (2) Where the question referred for arbitration is a question of construction, which is, generally speaking a question of law, the arbitrator 's decision can not be set aside only because the court would itself have come to a different conclusion, but if it appears on the face of the award that the arbitrator has proceeded illegally, as, for instance, by deciding on evidence which was not admissible, or on principles of construction which the law does not countenance, there is error in law which may be ground for setting aside the award.\n[683G H; 684A] (3) In order to set aside an award, there must be a wrong proposition of law laid down in the award as the basis of the award.\n[684D] (4) In the instant case, a question of law arose certainly during the course of the proceedings.\nSuch a question has been decided by the Umpire on a view which is a possible one to take.\nEven if there was no specific reference of a question referred to the Umpire, there was a question of law involved.\nEven on the assumption that such a view is not right, the award is not amenable to interference or correction by the Courts of law as there was no proposition of law which could be said to be the basis of the award of the Umpire, and which was erroneous.\n[689B Cl (5) The Umpire in his award stated that the decision of this Court covered and supported the claim of the claimant.\nIn the present case the only difference was that there was only an agreement which was held by the Umpire to have become operative.\nOnce that agreement was binding on the Board, its terms could not be vaired from the uniform rate under sub sections (1) and (2) of section 49.\nThe Umpire was right.\nThe Umpire committed no error in arriving at such conclusion.\nFurther more, such a conclusion was certainly a possible view of the interpretation of the decision of this Court in Indian Aluminium Co. 's case, if not the only view.\n[688G H; 689A] Indian Aluminium Co. Ltd. vs Kerala Electricity Board, ; ; Coimbatore Distt.\nP.T.

Verma, Jeet Mahajan and Ranjit Kumar for the Appellats.\nB. Sen, Gopal Subramanium and Mrs. Shobha Dikshit for the Respondent.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J.\nThis appeal by special leave is from the judgment and order of he High Court of Allahabad, dated 21st July, 1987.\nThe High Court has set aside the award of the Umpire.\nTo appreciate the decision and the contentions urged, a few facts are necessary.\nOn or about 20th October, 1962 there was a Bulk Supply Agreement entered into between Agra Electric Supply Co. Ltd. and the appellant herein, for supply of electrical energy to the latter 's hotel, inter alia, containing terms of rates, discounts, minimum sum payable and increase in the rates and sums payable once a year on account of increase in cost of production and distribution of electrical energy.\nClause 9 of the said agreement contained terms of the rate of supply and the contingencies in which such rates could be increased.\nThe said Clause provided as follows: PG NO. 674 \"The consumer shall, subject to the provisions hereinafter contained, pay to the Company for all electrical energy supplied and registered or estimated as herein provided at the rate of Rs.0.20 (Rupees zero decimal two zero) per unit per month for all energy so supplied and registered and/or estimated in the case of a defective meter installation in accordance with the proviso to clause 6 thereof.\nThe charge for all energy shall be subject to the scale of special discounts in accordance with the schedule annexed thereto.\nProvided that, (without regard to the quantity of units supplied) if the payment made or to be made for any one English Calendar year ending 31st March in respect of the electricity consumed shall fall short of a minimum sum of Rs. 38640 (Rs. Thirty eight thousand six hundred and forty) the consumer shall nevertheless pay to the Company such amount in addition to the payments already made in respect of the electricity consumed for such Calendar year as will, being the total payment made in this respect to the said minimum of Rs.38640 (Rs. Thirty eight thousand six hundred and forty).\nProvided Further that, in the event of the first and last years of this Agreement not being complete calendar year as aforesaid the Company shall make a proportionate reduction on the aforesaid annual Maximum Demand and Minimum charges in respect of the period for which the said first and last year as the case may be shall be less than a complete calendar year.\nProvided also that.\nif and whenever during the subsistence of this Agreement the Company is satisfied that there has been an increase in the cost of production and distribution of electrical energy it shall be at liberty (but not more than once in any year of accounts) to increase the rates and sums payable by the Consumer under the foregoing provision of this present clause 9 by such amount as it shall in its sole and absolute discretion decide.\n\" There was a clause providing for arbitration i.e. clause 18 which read as follows: \"If any question or difference whatsoever shall arise between the parties to these presents as to the PG NO 675 interpretation or effect of any provision or clause herein contained or the construction thereof or as to any other matter in anyway connected with or arising out of these presents or the operation thereof or the rights, duties or liabilities of either party in connection therewith, when unless the means for deciding any such question or difference is provided for by the or the as the case may be, or by the rules made respectively under the said Acts or by a specific provision of this Agreement, in every such case the matter in difference shall be referred to the Arbitration of two Arbitrators, one to be appointed by each party hereto, and an Umpire to be appointed by the Arbitrators before entering upon the reference and the decision or award of the said Arbitrators or Umpire shall be final and binding on the parties hereto and any reference made under this clause shall be deemed to be a submission to arbitration under the Indian (Act X of 1940) or any statutory modification or re enactment thereof for the time being in force.\nThe Arbitrators or the Umpire giving their or his decisions shall also decide by which party the cost of the Arbitration and award shall be paid and if by both parties in what proportion.\n\" On or from 26th September, 1973 the Agra Electric Supply Co. Ltd. increased per unit rate of electricity from 0.20 P to 21.5 P in terms of clause 9 of the said agreement.\nThereafter, the bills were sent @ 21.5 P per unit, after giving discounts and rebates as per the agreement.\nOn or about 17/18th December, 1973, the respondent herein took over the undertaking of the Agra Electric Supply Co. Ltd. On or about 16th January, 1974, the respondent informed the appellant by a written communication that consequent upon the expiry of licence granted to Agra Electric Supply Co. Ltd. to generate and supply electricity the respondent had taken it over and would supply electric energy to the hotel and that the Bulk Supply Agreement with Agra Electric Supply Co. Ltd. will continue to be in force with the respondent until such time the agreement is determined in accordance with its relevant provisions.\nAll bills received subsequent to the take over were billed at the agreed rate allowing discounts and rebates.\nOn or about 23rd November, 1974, the appellant received a communication from the respondent informing that uniform PG NO 676 tariff rates issued under section 49 of the Electricity Supply Act, 1949 will be applicable to the electrical energy supplied to the hotel w.e.f.\n12.10.1974.\nSection 49 of the (hereinafter called `the Act '), is to the following effect: \"49.\nProvision for the sale of electricity by the Board to persons other than licensees.\n(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and of regulations, if any, made in this behalf, the Board may supply electricity to any person not being a licensee upon such terms and conditions as the Board thinks fit and may for the purposes of such supply frame uniform tariff.\n(2) In fixing the uniform tariffs, the Board shall have regard to all or any of the following factors, namely: (a) the nature of supply and the purposes for which it is required: (b) the co ordinated development of the supply and distribution of electricity within the State in the most efficient and economical manner, with particular reference to such development in areas not for the time being served or adequately served by the licensee: (c) the simplification and standardisation of methods and rates of charge for such supplies; (d) the extension and cheapening of supplies of electricity to sparsely developed areas.\n(3) Nothing in the foregoing provisions of this section shall derogate from the power of the Board, if it considers it necessary or expedient to fix different tariffs for the supply of electricity to any person not being a licensee, having regard to the geographical position or any area, the nature of the supply, and purpose for which supply is required and any other relevant factors.\n(4) In fixing the tariff and terms and conditions for the supply of electricity, the Board shall not show undue preference to any person.\n\" PG NO.\n677 After the said date the bills were sent at the enhanced rate of 0.30 P per unit, adding fuel cost variation charges and without allowing any discount or rebate.\nOn or about 28th November, 1974, the appellant, however, protested against the unilateral withdrawal of contractual discount and rebates and enhancement in the rates and drew the attention of the respondent to the existing and subsisting bulk supply agreement, but the respondent took no action.\nOn or about 31st August, 1976, a Circular was issued by the Chief Engineer of the respondent advising all Engineers in charge of the undertakings to bill the consumers having special agreements with the ex licensees as per those agreements and steps be taken to terminate the old agreements with new agreements providing for application of tariff.\nOn 7th October, 1977, vide written communication the appellant informed the respondent that upon latter 's failure to resolve the disputes and differences arising between them consequent to the illegal increase in the rates and discontinuation of discounts and rebates w.e.f.\n12.10.1974, the appellant was referring the disputes for decision by the arbitrator and appointed Justice Manchanda, a retired Judge of the Allahabad High Court, as the arbitrator and the respondent appointed Justice Nigam, another retired Judge of the same High Court, as its arbitrator.\nOn or about 8th April, 1977, the joint arbitrators appointed Justice V. Bhargava, a retired Judge of this Court, as an Umpire.\nBetween 3rd November, 1979 and 4th March, 1980, several sittings were held before the arbitrators but the parties were unable to agree and upon their disagreement the disputes were referred to the learned Umpire for decision.\nFrom 4th March, 1980 onwards, proceedings started before the Umpire and there was a plea for de novo hearing of the proceedings before the Umpire, by the respondent.\nThe learned Umpire started de novo proceedings taking evidence of the parties.\nOn 21st March, 1980, the respondent filed an application, being Case No. 59 of 1980 under section 33 of the before the District Judge, Lucknow, denying the existence of the agreement dated 20th October, 1962.\nThe respondent also denied the acceptance and adoption of the agreement consequent upon the take over and sought a declaration from the Court that the arbitration agreement did not exist.\nThe Vth Addl.\nDistrict Judge by his order dated 27.5.1983 held that the agreement was duly executed, accepted and adopted by the respondent and was binding on it and that the arbitration proceedings were pursuant to the arbitration clause and, as such, the application under section 33 of the , was rejected.\nPG NO.\n678 On 1st June, 1983, the award was made by the learned Umpire holding that in terms of clause 9 the increase in the unit rate was permissible and the fuel cost variation charges which were variable every month was contrary to clause 9 as increase was permitted only once in a year of accounts, and further held that the appellant was entitled to discount of 50% on the charges for electricity; and was also entitled to 0.03 paise per rupee for prompt payment of bills.\nThe learned Umpire in his award set out the facts and therein recited these as follows: \"The main terms of the agreement were that in respect of the bulk electric supply to the petitioner the Hotel was to be charged at the rate of twenty paise per unit per month.\nThere was also a clause for granting a special discount to the petitioner to the extent of 50% and in addition a cash discount of three paise per whole rupee was to be allowed to the petitioner in case the petitioner paid the bills of the Company within the stipulated period.\nThe bills for the electric energy supplied by the Supply Company continued on these contractual rates till October 1974, even after the Supply Company was acquired by the opposite party in December 1973, and the bills were accordingly paid.\nHowever, in October 1974, the opposite party under section 49 of the (hereinafter referred to as the Act) unilaterally and according to the petitioner illegally and arbitrarily purported to replace the original terms in the agreement and revised the charges with effect from 12th October, 1974.\nThe Board, under this notification, increased the rate of electricity supplied to 30 paise per unit and further refused to grant the discount to which the petitioner was entitled under the agreement as well as the cash discount of three paise per rupee.\nThe opposite party further levied a fuel cost adjustment charges and subsequently the rate was raised to 31 paise per unit with effect from June 1976.\n\" Thereafter, the learned Umpire set out the history of the negotiations between the parties resulting in the agreement dated 20.10.1962.\nAfter referring to the bulk supply agreement the learned arbitrator set out the terms upon which supply was made to the appellant.\nThe appellant was to make an initial payment of Rs.35,326 towards service connection for the purpose of supply, though irrespective of PG NO 679 the payment the service connection was to continue to be the property of the Supply Company.\nThe Supply Company was to make provision in the appellant 's monthly bill granting a rebate of Rs. 147.20 for each month that the agreement remained inforce upto a maximum of 20 years.\nUnder para 9 of the agreement the appellant was to pay the Company for all electric energy supplied, registered, and estimated at the rate of 20 paise p.m.\nThe charges for energy consumed were subject to special discount according to the scale in the schedule which permitted a maximum discount of 50% in case a minimum of 41,000 units were consumed in each month.\nThe consumption as shown by the record was never less than 41,000 units p.m.\nIn addition, there was a provision under clause (ii) of the agreement for cash discount of 3 paise per whole rupee in case payment was made within the stipulated period.\nUnder the first proviso to para 9, the appellant had to pay a minimum sum of Rs.38,640 for electricity consumed in any English calendar year.\nThe provision made was that in addition to the amount paid in accordance with the bills, the appellant was to make payment in such cases so as to make up the said minimum of Rs.38,640.\nThe second proviso laid down that if and whenever during the subsistence of the agreement the Supply Company was satisfied that there was an increase in the cost of production and distribution of electric energy it shall be at liberty (but not more than once a year) to increase the rates and sums payable by the consumer under the provisions of clause 9 by such amount as the Company shall, in its sole and absolute discretion, decide.\nHence, it was held by the Umpire on the oral and documentary evidence that the payment was made at the enhanced rate under protest.\nChallenging the Award, several contentions were raised, namely, (i) that there was no agreement in existence and that neither the Umpire nor the arbitrator had any jurisdiction to make the award.\nThis contention was rejected and no argument was advanced before us challenging this finding of the Umpire, (ii) that the appellant should prove the terms and conditions upon which the Supply Company was supplying the electricity to the appellant.\nThis the Umpire held, had been duty proved and there was no challenge to either of the findings of the Umpire.\n(iii) it was thirdly contended that the agreement even if in existence, was not binding upon the respondent.\nand that while admitting that the respondent under section 49 of the Act, issued Notification under which the tariff was revised w.e.f.\n12.10.1974, it was claimed that the opposite party had not, in any way, failed to fulfil its obligations on the alleged agreement and that the opposite party was fully competent under law to fix a uniform tariff and also to levy fuel PG NO 680 adjustment charges.\nThis is the main and substantial question involved in this matter.\nIt was then contended that the respondent was entitled even under the agreement and under its second proviso to clause 9 to revise the tariff and the appellant was not entitled to any relief.\nIt was further urged that the payments were made after coming into operation of the , under protest.\nIn respect of these contentions the learned Umpire held that the plea was that even if the agreement was in existence, it was not binding on the opposite party and that the opposite party was competent under section 49 of the Electricity Supply Act, to fix revised charges w.e.f.\n12.10.1974 and had not violated any terms of the agreement.\nThe appellant had also relied on the alternative provisions of section 49(3) of the Act, set out hereinbefore.\nThe said sub section (3) provides that nothing contained in sub sections (1) & (2) of section 49 shall derogate from the power of the Board, if it happens to enter into an agreement at different rates of tariff with any person other than a licensee.\nIt appears that when the Supply Company was taken over on l7/18.12.1973, the resident Engineer wrote a letter on 16.1.1974 in which he informed the appellant that the licence of M/s. Agra Electric Supply Co. Ltd. having expired and the U.P. State Electricity Board having taken over the supply, it was to supply energy to the appellant at the aforesaid date.\nTheir further contention was that the bulk supply agreement which the appellant had with M/s. Agra Electric Supply Co. Ltd., would continue to be in force with the State Electricity Board until such time as the agreement was determined in accordance with the relevant provisions thereof.\nThe learned Umpire held that the letter clearly laid down that the U.P. Electricity Board had accepted the agreement which was in existence between the Supply Company and the appellant, and the Umpire proceeded on that basis.\nThe learned Umpire further stated as follows: \"The Board thus having accepted the agreement with the claimant, it became binding on the Board and under sub section (3) of section 49 of the Electric Supply Act nothing contained in sub sections (1) & (2) of section 49 of the Act could have any bearing on the terms of the agreement.\nThe result was that the uniform tariff fixed by the Board with effect from 12th October, 1974 did not apply to the claimant and the claimant had to be granted the various rebates laid down in the agreement.\nThe decision of the Supreme Court in Indian Aluminium Co. Ltd. vs Kerala Electricity Board, PG NO 681 [1976] 1 SCR pa.\n70 fully covers the case and supports the claim of the claimant.\nIn the case before the Supreme Court an agreement had been entered into by the State Government and it was held that under section 60 of the Electricity Supply Act, 1940 it became binding on the Kerala State Electricity Board and further that that agreement was enforceable under sub section (3) of s 49 irrespective of the fixation of uniform tariff under sub sections (I) and (2) of section 49.\nIn the present case the only difference is that instead of the agreement being first binding between the consumer and the State Government, the agreement became binding on the Electricity Board, because it accepted the agreement and became a party to it by letter dated 16th January 1974 (exhibit R).\n\" The aforesaid basis of the decision, it was contended, was the error of law which vitiated the award.\nThis question will require further consideration later.\nIt was held that the decision in Indian Aluminium Co., (supra) fully covered the dispute on this aspect in the instant case.\nThe learned Umpire further held as follows: \"Once the agreement was binding on the Board its terms under sub section (3) of section 49 could not be varied by fixation of uniform tariff under sub sections (1) and (2) of section 49.\nThe opposite party in these circumstances must be held to have failed to fulfil its obligations under the agreement\".\nOn 1st July, 1983.\nan application was made under section 12 [2] of the before the learned District Judge, Lucknow, for filing of the award and making the same Rule of the Court.\nObjections were filed by the respondent against the said award.\nThe learned kind Addl.\nDistt.\nJudge, Lucknow, held that the award was legal, valid and binding on the parties and the alleged grounds of misconduct were not maintainable.\nThe award was.\nhowever, set aside on the ground that the reference made to arbitration was unilateral.\nThe appellant filed an appeal.\nThe Lucknow Bench of the Allahahad High Court held against the finding of the Ilnd Additional Distt.\nJudge Lucknow that the reference was unilateral.\nbut set aside the award on the ground that there was an error of law apparent on the face of it in view of the agreement dated 20.10. 1962 and the ratio of the decision of this Court in Indian Aluminium Co., (supra).\nThe revision filed by the respondent against the judgment of the Vth Addl.\nDistt Judge, Lucknow was also rejected.\nThis appeal is from the aforesaid decision of the High Court by special leave.\nPG NO 682 The two learned Judges of the High Court gave separate judgments.\nThe High Court was of the view that the instant case was distinct from the facts in the case of Indian Aluminium Co., (supra).\nThere it was held that where a stipulation in a contract is entered into by a public authority in exercise of a statutory power then, even though such stipulation fetters subsequent exercise of the same statutory power, it would be valid and the exercise of such statutory power would pro tanto stand restricted.\nMr Justice Loomba was of the view that in the instant case even if the stipulation as to the tariff structure in the agreement by taken to have been continued to be in existence in view of sub section (3) of section 49 of the Act, the same was not unrestricted.\nThe stipulation was expressly made subject to certain reservations as would be clear from the opening sentence of clause 9 of the agreement, the main clause was \"subject to the provisions hereinafter contained\".\nMr Justice Loomba was of the view that the decision of the Indian Aluminium Co., (supra) case was inapplicable to the present case.\nAccording to the learned Judge, the mistake committed by the Umpire was a manifest error.\nIt was further stated that it is well settled proposition of law that if the reasons are stated on the basis of which the award was made and such reasons are found to be erroneous, the errors become apparent on the face of the award and constitute legal misconduct on the part of the Umpire vitiating the award.\nThe other learned Judge Mr Justice Mathur also held that there was error of law apparent on the face of the award of the Umpire.\nHe was of the opinion that the expression \"sum payable by the consumer under the foregoing provision of this present clause 9\" was subject to the discounts mentioned in the subsequent clauses of the agreement.\nIn view of the discounts, the sum payable under clause 9 was altered and the altered amount becomes the sum payable under clause 9.\nAccording to the learned Judge, since the amount determined after allowing discounts is also sum payable under clause 9, it followed that in exercise of the power conferred under the third proviso, the discount could only be tampered with in the same way the unit charge could be tampered with.\nBeyond this it was not permissible.\nIn permitting this the Umpire committed an error in drawing distinction between 'rates ' and 'discount ' and upholding the right of the Board to tamper with the former and negating similar right in respect of the latter.\nAccording to the learned Judge, this was a wrong understanding of the decision of the Indian Aluminium 's case (supra).\nIn the aforesaid view of the matter, the learned Judge agreed with the other learned Judge and held that the award was vitiated.\nPG NO 683 It appears that the main question that arises is: whether the decision of this Court in Indian Aluminium 's case (supra) was properly understood and appreciated by the learned Umpire and whether he properly applied the agreement between the parties in the light of the aforesaid decision.\nIt was contended that the question was whether the sums payable under clause 9 included discounts.\nOn the aforesaid basis it was contended that there was an error of law and such error was manifest on the face of the award.\nEven assuming, however, that there was an error of construction of the agreement or even that there was an error of law in arriving at a conclusion, such an error is not an error which is amenable to correction even in a reasoned award under the law.\nReference may be made to the observations of this Court in Coimbatore Distt.\nP.T. Sangam vs Bala Subramania Foundry, AlR , where it was reiterated that an award can only be set aside if there is an error on its face.\nFurther, it is an error of law and not mistake of fact committed by the arbitrator which is justiciable in the application before the Court.\nWhere the alleged mistakes or errors, if any, of which grievances were made were mistakes of facts if at all, and did not amount to error of law apparent on the face of the record, the objections were not sustainable and the award could not be set aside.\nSee also the observations of this Court in Delhi Municipal Corpn.\nvs M/S. Jagan Nath Ashok Kumar, ; , where this Court reiterated that reasonableness of the reasons given by an arbitrator in making his award cannot be challenged.\nIn that case before this Court, there was no evidence of violation of any principle of natural justice, and in this case also there is no violation of the principles of natural justice.\nIt may be possible that on the same evidence some court might have arrived at some different conclusion than the one arrived at by the arbitrator but that by itself is no ground for setting aside the award of an arbitrator.\nAlso see the observations of Halsbury 's Laws of England, 4th Edn., Vol. 2, at pages 334 & 335, para 624, where it was reiterated that an arbitrator 's award may be set aside for error of law appearing on the face of it, though that jurisdiction is not lightly to be exercised.\nIf a specific question of law is submitted to the arbitrator for his decision and he decides it, the fact that the decision is erroneous does not make the award bad on its face so as to permit it being set aside; and where the question referred for arbitration is a question of construction, which is, generally speaking, a question of law, the arbitrator 's decision cannot be set aside only because the court would itself have come to a different conclusion; but if it appears on the face of the award that the arbitrator has proceeded illegally, as, for instance, by deciding on evidence which was not admissible, or on principles of construction which the law does not PG NO 684 countenance, there is error in law which may be ground for setting aside the award.\nIt was contended by Mr F.S. Nariman, counsel for the appellant, that a specific question of law being a question of construction had been referred to the Umpire and, hence, his decision, right or wrong, had to be accepted.\nIn view of clause 18, it was submitted that in this case a specific reference had been made in the interpretation of the agreement between the parties, hence, the parties were bound by the decision of the Umpire.\nOur attention was drawn to the observations of this Court in M/s. Hindustan Tea Co. vs M/s. K. Sashikant & Co., AIR 1987 SC 81, where this Court held that under the law, the arbitrator is made the final arbiter of the dispute between the parties, referred to him.\nThe award is not open to challenge on the ground that the arbitrator has reached a wrong conclusion or has failed to appreciate facts.\nWhere the award which was a reasoned one was challenged on the ground that the arbitrator had acted contrary to the provisions of section 70 of the Contract Act, it was held that the same could not be set aside.\nIn order to set aside an award, there must be a wrong proposition of law laid down in the award as the basis of the award.\nFor this see the observations of this Court in Kanpur Nagar Mahapalika vs M/s.\nNarain Das Haribansh, In that case the appellant had entered into a contract with the respondent for certain construction work.\nThe contract contained an arbitration agreement between the parties.\nThe respondent filed a suit in 1946 claiming certain moneys due against its final bills but, at the instance of the appellant, the suit was stayed and the matter referred to arbitration.\nThe arbitrator made an award in March 1960 in favour of the plaintiffs determining the amount payable by the appellant.\nThereafter the appellant made an application for setting aside the award on the ground that the arbitrator had misconducted himself in not properly considering that the claim of the respondent was barred by limitation under section 326 of the U.P. Act 2 of 1916.\nAlthough the trial court set aside the award, the High Court, in appeal, reversed this decision.\nIn appeal to this Court it was contended for the appellant that the award was bad by reason of an error apparent on its face.\nDismissing the appeal, it was held that there could not be predicated of the award that there was any proposition of law forming the basis of the award, and, therefore, it could not be said that there was any error apparent on the face of the award.\nPG NO 685 The Judicial Committee in the famous decision of Champsey Bhara & Co. vs Jivraj Balloo Spinning & Weaving Co. Ltd., [ held that the error of law on the face of the award means that one can find in the award or in document incorporated thereto as, for instance, a note appended by the arbitrator stating the reasons for his judgment, some legal proposition which is the basis of the award and which is erroneous.\nThe same view was reiterated by this Court in Dr. S.B. Dutt vs University of Delhi, ; In this case.\nMr. Nariman appearing for the appellant contended that there was no proposition of law as such stated by the Umpire which could be said to be the basis of his decision.\nHence, the award was not amenable to corrections on the ground that there was an error of law apparent on its face.\nMr. Nariman further submitted that the Umpire had decided the specific question of law and such a decision, right or wrong, is binding on the parties.\nIn aid of his submission Mr. Nariman referred to the decision of this Court in M/s. Kapoor Nilokheri Co op.\nDairy Farm Society Ltd. vs Union of India & Ors., [ , where it was held that in a case of arbitration where the appellants had sepcifically stated that their claims were based on the agreement and on nothing else and all that the arbitrator had to decide was as to the effect of an agreement between the appellant and the respondent, the arbitrator had really to decide a question of law i.e. of interpreting the document, the agreement.\nSuch a decision his, is not open to challenge.\nOur attention was drawn to the observations of this Court in Tarapore & Co. vs Cochin Shipyard Lld.\nCochin & Anr., [l984] 3 SCR 118, where Desai J., spoke for the Court and Justice Chinnappa Reddy agreed with him.\nIt was stated that a question of law might figure before an arbitrator in two ways.\nIt may arise as an incidental point while deciding the main dispute referred to the arbitrator or in a given case parties may refer a specific question of law to the arbitrator for his decision.\nThis Court reiterated that the arbitration has been considered a civilised way of resolving disputes avoiding court proceedings.\nThere was no reason why the parties should be precluded from referring a specific question of law to an arbitrator for his decision and agree to be bound by the same.\nThis approach manifests faith of parties in the capacity of the tribunal of their choice to decide even a pure question of law.\nIf they do so, with eyes wide open, there is nothing to preclude the parties from doing so.\nIf a question of law is specifically referred and it becomes evident that the parties desired to have a decision on the specific question from the arbitrator rather than one from the Court, then the court will not interfere PG NO 686 with the award of the arbitrator on the ground that there was an error or law apparent on the face of the award even if the view of law taken by the arbitrator did not accord with the view of the court.\nA long line of decisions was relied upon by this Court for that proposition.\nMr. B. Sen, learned counsel for the respondent, however, contended that in the present case, there was no specific question of law referred to the Umpire.\nHe submitted that it was a general reference in which a question of law arose.\nIt was any question in the proceedings and the question of law, as such, did not arise.\nAccording to Mr. Sen, the mistake that the Umpire, has committed is clear from his following statement: \"The Board thus having accepted the agreement with the claimant, it became binding on the Board and under sub section [3] of section 49 of the Electricity Supply Act nothing contained in sub section ( 1) & (2) of section 49 of the Act could have any bearing on the terms of the agreement.\nThe result was that the uniform tariff fixed by the Board with effect from 12th October, 1974 did not apply\".\nIt was stated that no specific question having been referred to, this mistake was fatal.\nWe are unable to accept this submission.\nOur attention was drawn by Mr. Nariman to the observations of Justice Macnaghten in Hitchins & Anr.\nvs British Coal Refining Processes Ltd., [1936] 2 A.E.R. Reprint 191.\nIhere, by an agreement the applicants were to act as consulting Engineers in connection with a certain coal refining process owned by the respondents.\nWhile the plant for the working of the process was being erected, a dispute arose.\nthe respondents wanting the applicants to attend every day at the site of the plant and the applicants considering this to be no part of their duty.\nThe respondents thereupon terminated the agreement and the matter was referred to arbitration.\nThe applicants pleaded that the termination of the agreement was unjustified; the respondents pleaded that the applicants should have attended every day and that they had been quilty of negligence in respect of certain matters set out in the counterclaim.\nThe arbitrator found the termination of the agreement to be unjustified and also negligence on the part of the appellants in respect of the matters set out in the counterclaim, and he awarded the appellants damages after setting off an unspecified amount for damages for negligence.\nThe respondents moved to set aside the award on PG NO 687 the ground of error of law apparent on the face of it.\nAt the hearing the respondents contended that the whole of the pleadings in the arbitration were admissible.\nThe respondents contended that for the purpose of deciding whether there was an error of law apparent on the face of the award, the court could not look at any document except the award itself.\nThe respondents further contended that the arbitrator had committed an error of law in deciding that the negligence found did not afford sufficient ground for the termination of the agreement, and further that on the true consideration of the agreement, the refusal to attend daily was as a matter of law a sufficient ground for the termination of the agreement.\nIt was held that inasmuch as the arbitrator in his award referred to certain paragraphs in the counterclaim, such paras ought, in considering whether there was an error on the face of the award, to be regarded as forming part of the award.\nWhether misconduct justifies dismissal is a question of fact, and the arbitrator 's decision was final.\nIt was further held that the light to terminate the agreement because the applicants refused to attend daily was a question specifically submitted to the arbitrator and the court could not interfere with his decision, even if the question was a question of law.\nMr. Justice Macnaghten at page 195 of the report observed that it was permissible to look at the whole of the pleadings delivered in the arbitration, and it appears therein that the respondents affirmed and the applicants denied that the respondents were entitled to terminate the agreement as the applicants refused to attend daily at the site, and that this was a specific question submitted to the decision of the arbitrator.\nOur attention was also drawn to the observations of House of Lords in Pioneer Shipping Ltd. and Ors.\nvs ETP Tioxide Ltd., In that case by a charterparty dated 2nd November, 197 the owners of a vessel chartered her to the charterers.\nIt was held by the House of Lords that having regard to the purpose the Arbitration Act, 1970 of England which was to promote greater finality in arbitration awards then had been the case under the special case procedure judicial interference with the arbitrator 's award was only justified if it was shown that the arbitrator had misdirected himself in law or had reached a decision which no reasonable arbitrator could have.\nIn the instant case, the view taken by the Umpire on the interpretation of the agreement between the parties in the light of the observations of this Court in Indian Aluminium Co. 's case (supra) was at best a possible view to take, if not the correct view.\nIf that was the position then such a view, even if wrong, cannot be corrected by this Court on the basis6is of long line of decisions of this Court.\nIn the PG NO 688 aforesaid view of the matter it is necessary to examine the aforesaid decision in the Indian Aluminium Co 's case (supra).\nThere under section 49(1) & (2) of the Electricity Supply Act, 1948, the Legislature had empowered the State Electricity Board to frame uniform tariffs and had also indicated the factors to be taken into account in fixing uniform tariffs.\nUnder sub section (3), the Board was empowered, in the special circumstances mentioned therein, to fix different tariffs for the supply of electricity, but in doing so, sub section (4) directed that the Board was not to show undue preference to any person.\nUnder section 59 it was stipulated that the Board shall not, as far as practicable, carry on its operations at a loss and shall adjust its charges accordingly from time to time.\nCertain consumers of electricity had entered into agreements for the supply of electricity for their manufacturing purposes at specified rates for specified period.\nSome of the agreements were entered into with the State Governments and the others with the State Electricity Boards.\nIn one of the agreements there was an arbitration clause.\nOn account of the increase in the operation and maintenance cost, due to various causes which caused loss to the State Electricity Boards, the Boards wanted to increase the charges in all the cases.\nThe consumers challenged the competency of the Boards to do so by petitions in the respective High Courts.\nThe High Court sustained the Board 's claim, in some cases, under sections 49 & 59, and in others, held that the Board was incompetent to do so.\nIn the case of the consumer where there was the arbitration clause.\nthe High Court refused to entertain the petition on account of the clause.\nThis Court held that fixation of special tariffs under section 49 (3) can be a unilateral Act on the part of the Board but more often it is the result of negotiations between the Board and the consumer and hence a matter of agreement between them.\nTherefore, the Board can, in exercise of the power conferred under the sub section, enter into an agreement with a consumer stipulating for special tariff for supply of electricity for a specific period of time.\nThe agreements for supply of electricity to the consumers must therefore he regarded as having been entered into by the Boards in exercise of the statutory power conferred under section 49(3).\nThe Umpire in his award stated that the decision of this Court covered and supported the claim of the claimant.\nIn the present case the only difference is that there was only an agreement by which the Electricity Board accepted the agreement which was held by the Umpire to have become operative.\nOnce that agreement was binding on the Board, its terms could not be varied from the uniform rate under sub sections (1) and (2) of section 49.\nThe Umpire was right.\nIn our opinion, the Umpire committed no error in arriving at such conclusion.\nFurthermore, such a conclusion is certainly a possible view of the interpretation of the decision of this PG NO 689 Court in Indian Aluminium Co 's case, if not the only view.\nWe need go no further than that.\nWe, are, therefore, of the opinion that the view taken by the Umpire on section 49 was a possible view in the light of the decision of this Court in Indian Aluminium 's case.\nIn the premises, a question of law arose certainly during the course of the proceedings.\nSuch a question has been decided by the Umpire on a view which is a possible one to take.\nEven if there was no specific reference of a question of law referred to the Umpire, there was a question of law involved.\nEven on the assumption that such a view is not right, the award is not amenable to interference or correction by the courts of law as there is no proposition of law which could be said to be the basis of the award of the Umpire, and which is erroneous.\nIn the premises, we are of the opinion that the High Court and the learned IInd Additional District Judge were in error in the view they took of the award of the Umpire.\nThe appeal must, therefore, be allowed and the decision of the High Court, dated 21st July, 1987 as well as the order of the IInd Additional Judge, Lucknow, dated 30th May, 1984 are set aside.\nNo other point was urged challenging the award of the Umpire.\nThe award of the Umpire is confirmed and let the award be made Rule of the Court under section 14(2) of the Act.\nThe appeal is allowed with costs.\nR.S.S. Appeal allowed.\n",

    "main_story": "ivil Appeal Nos. 410 and 520(N) of 1973.\nFrom the Judgment and Decree dated 21/22/23.11.1972 of the Gujarat High Court in First Appeal Nos. 454 and 455 of 1970.\nB.K. Mehta, D.N. Misra, J.B. Dadachanji & Co. and N.J. Modi, for the Appellants.\n236 S.K. Dholakia, P.H. Parekh, J.H. Parekh, Ms. Sunita Sharma, Krishan Kumar, Vimal Dave and H.J. Javeri, for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHARMA, J.\nThese appeals are directed against the deci sion of the Gujarat High Court in an appeal arising out of a suit for partition instituted by the respondent No. 1, Vadilal Bapalal Modi (since deceased).\nThe father of the plaintiff Vadilal was Bapalal who had 5 sons the plaintiff, Ramanlal, Gulabchand, Kantilal and Jayantilal; and a daughter Champaben.\nGulabchand was impleaded as the first defendant in the suit and on his death his heirs and legal representatives have been substi tuted.\nKantilal and Champaben are defendants No. 2 and 3 respectively.\nRamanlal predeceased Bapalal and his wife and son are defendants No. 4 and 5.\nJayantilal also died earlier and his wife Smt.\nChandrakantaben, defendant No. 6 is the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 418 of 1973.\nTheir children are defendants No. 7 to 12.\nCiviI Appeal No. 520 of 1973 has been preferred by the 7th defendant, Narendra.\nThe suit by VadilaI was instituted in 1960, claiming share in the considerably large properties detailed in the Schedule to the plaint, but the present appeals are not related to any other item excepting the property described as a chawl admeasuring 7 acres and 2 gunthas of land with 115 rooms and huts, situated in the Naroda locality in Ahmedabad under Lot No. 8 of the plaint which has been referred to by the counsel for the parties before us as the chawl or the Naroda chawl.\nAccording to the case of the defendants No. 6 to 12, this property exclusively belongs to defendant No. 6 and is not liable to partition.\nThe other defendants contested the claim of the plaintiff with respect to some other items, but so far the disputed chawl is con cerned, they supported the plaintiffs ' case that it belonged to the joint family and is liable to partition.\nThe land of Lot No. 8 was acquired by Bapalal in 1932 for a sum of Rs.9,450 and the rooms were constructed thereon in about 1934.\nIt has been held by the High Court, and the finding has not been challenged before us, that Bapalal acquired the property and built the chawl with the aid of ancestral joint funds, and the property, therefore, belonged to the family.\nAccording to the case of the defendants 237 No. 6 to 12, Bapalal orally gifted the property to his daughter in law Chandrakanta the 6th defendant, in March, 1946 and made a statement before the Revenue authorities on the basis of which her name was mutated, and she was put in possession thereof.\nAdmittedly 114 rooms in the Naroda chawl had been let out to tenants, and one room was retained for the caretaker.\nAccording to Chandrakanta 's case, although she came in peaceful possession, the management which in cluded realisation of rent was in the hands of Gulabchand (defendant No. 1).\nIt appears that in 1952 some dispute arose and Chandrakanta assumed direct charge of the Naroda chawl and has remained in possession thereafter.\nThus she has been in exclusive possession of the disputed chawl since 1946, and acquired good title therein by adverse possession before the suit was filed in 1960.\nThe learned Judge, City Civil Court, Ahmedabad, who tried the suit, held that BapalaI and his sons constituted a joint Hindu family and the business carried on by Bapalal was for the benefit of the family and the income from the business was thrown in the common pool and all the proper ties including the disputed chawl were treated as belonging to the family.\nProceeding further it has been found that the case of the defendant No. 6 about the gift, the mutation of her name, and her exclusive possession from 1946 till the date of the suit was correct.\nShe was accordingly held to have acquired a title by adverse possession.\nThe suit, therefore, was dismissed with respect to the disputed chawl.\nFor the purpose of the present appeal it is not essential to mention the findings of the trial court relating to the other items of the suit property.\nThe plaintiff appealed before the Gujarat High Court.\nSome of the defendants also filed two separate appeals against the judgment of the trial court dealing with other items of property with which we are not concerned.\nThe appeals were heard and disposed of to gether by a common judgment in November 1972.\nThe High Court reversed the finding of adverse possession in regard to the disputed chawl and granted a decree for partition.\nIt was held that the defendant No. 6 remained in exclusive posses sion of the property only since 1952 and the period was thus short of the time required for prescription of title.\nDeal ing with the relief for rendition of accounts, the Court held that since the rents of the chawl from 1952 were col lected by Jayantilal, Chandrakanta 's husband and after his death by her son Narendra (defendant No. 7), Chandrakanta was liable to render accounts till the death of her husband and she along with defendant No. 7 would be jointly liable for the period thereafter.\nThe present appeals are directed against this judgment.\n238 5.\nAccording to the case of the defendant No. 6, her husband, Jayantilal, used to indulge in speculative business and he was, therefore, not considered a dependable person.\nTo ensure economic stability of Chandrakanta and her chil dren, her father in law, Bapalal decided to make a gift of the Naroda chawl to her.\nBoth Bapalal and Chandrakanta appeared before the Talati of Naroda on 5.3.1946 and made statements.\nThe original statement of Bapalal recorded by the Talati and signed by Bapalal was produced and marked as Ext.\n268 in the trial court and similarly the statement of Chandrakanta as Ext.\nBapalal has stated in Ext.\n268 that Chandrakanta had loyally served him and, therefore, he was making the gift.\nA prayer was made for substitution of her name in the revenue records.\nA similar prayer was made by the lady in Ext.\nThe extract from the Record of Rights is Ext.\n247 which mentions Bapalal as the occupant of the Naroda chawl.\nThe entry was made in May 1933.\nThis entry appears to have been placed within brackets and a second entry inserted mentioning Chandrakanta 'wife of Jayantilal Bapalal '.\nMr. B.K. Mehta, the learned counsel for the appel lant has strongly relied upon the revenue entry as proof of her title.\nReference was made to the decision in Gangabai and others vs Fakirgowda Somaypagowda Desai and others, A.I.R. 1930 Privy Council 93; and Desai Navinkant Kesarlal vs Prabhat Kabhai, 9 Gujarat Law Reporter 694.\nIt was point ed out by the learned counsel that in the Privy Council case also the revenue records, which were under consideration, were prepared under the Bombay Land Revenue Code, that is the same Code under which Ext.\n247 was prepared and it was observed in the judgment that the revenue entry furnished presumptive evidence of title.\nThe Gujarat case also indi cated that a presumption as to the rights in the concerned property arose in favour of the person whose name was en tered.\nWe are not very much impressed by this part of argu ment of the learned counsel as it cannot be denied that title to Naroda chawl could not have passed to the defendant No. 6 by virtue of the entry Ext.\nThe value of the chawl even in 1946 was large and no registered instrument of transfer was executed.\nBesides Ext.\n247 describes Bapalal and thereafter Chandrakanta as Kabjedar, that is, occupant.\nIn these circumstances the presumption which can be raised in favour of Chandrakanta from this entry is with respect to her possession and possession only.\nThere is a serious dispute between the parties as to the actual physical possession of the chawl during the period 1946 to 1952 and we will have to consider the evi dence on this aspect in some detail.\nIn 1952 there was direct confrontation between Chandrakanta and the defendant No. 1, Gulabchand.\nOn 14.4.1952 a public notice was 239 published in a local daily named 'Sandesh ' vide Ext.\n254 wherein Gulabchand informed and called upon the tenants in the chawl to pay the rent to him within 3 days against receipts to be issued, failing which legal steps would be taken against them.\nOn the very next day 'Sandesh ' carried another public notice Ext.\n255 issued by Chandrakanta as serting her title and exclusive possession and repudiating the claim of Gulabchand.\nThe tenants were warned that Gulab chand or any other person on his behalf had no right or authority to dispute her claim.\nOn the same day, i.e., on 15.4.1952 another public notice was published in 'Sandesh ' at the instance of Gulabchand reiterating his claim and asserting that his father Bapalal (who was then alive) was the owner.\nIt appears that no further action was taken by any of the parties.\nThe evidence on the record shows that Bapalal had withdrawn himself from wordly affairs and was staying in Vrindavan near Mathura.\nThe evidence led by Chandrakanta of her exclusive possession from 1952 through her husband and son till the date of the suit was accepted as reliable by the High Court.\nThus there is concurrent finding of both the two courts below accepting her exclusive possession from 1952 onwards.\nThe learned counsel for the plaintiff has, therefore, rightly not challenged before us this finding which we are independently also satisfied is a correct one.\nThe actual position of the chawl from 1946 to 1952 becomes crucial, as Chandrakanta is bound to fail if she is not successful in proving her adverse possession for this period.\nAs has been stated earlier, the suit was filed in 1960 and her possession since 1952 cannot be treated long enough for a prescriptive title to accrue.\nThe parties have, therefore, taken great pains to prove before us their rival cases as to the possession of the chawl from 1946 to 1952.\nThe defendant No. 1 was admittedly managing the properties belonging to the family.\nOut of 115 rooms in Naroda chawl only 114 were let out to tenants and one room was retained in which, according to the case of Chandrakan ta, a caretaker known as Gangia Pathan, engaged by Bapalal, was staying.\nAfter collecting the rent from the tenants the Pathan used to hand over the money to the defendant No. 1.\nAfter the gift, it was decided that the same arrangement would continue but the defendant No. 1 would be managing the property on her behalf and after receipt of the rent he would deliver the same to her.\nShe claims that this arrange ment was acted upon.\nAdmittedly the total rent collection from the chawl was not large and after deducting the ex penses including the maintenance and repair costs and the salary of the Jamadar (caretaker) the money left was not a considerable sum.\n240 According to the evidence of Chandrakanta the Pathan left the service and his whereabouts are not known and another Jamadar with the name of Maganji came in his place.\nHe looked after the chawl till 1950.\nThereafter he was substi tuted by Nathu Singh.\nMaganji 's present whereabouts are also not known.\nIn 1952 Gulabchand made a claim to the chawl repudiating the ownership of Chandrakanta and he was, there fore, removed.\nThe appellant has relied on a large number of rent receipts filed by her and her learned counsel laid great stress on five of them which have been marked as Exts.\n240 to 243 and 250 issued in December 1947, January 1948, June 1948 April 1949 and July 1947 respectively.\nIt is signifi cant to note that the defendant No. 1 was in charge of the collection of the rent upto 1952 according to the case of all the parties.\nThe parties contesting the claim of the appellant contend that he was so doing on behalf of the entire family and not on behalf of Chandrakanta as claimed by her.\nThe defendant No. 1, however, did not choose to enter the witness box nor did he produce any document which could have supported his case.\nThe counter foil receipts were in his possession and neither they were filed by the defendant No. 1 nor the plaintiff called for the same.\nDefendant No. 6 was able to examine two of the tenants Vajesingh (D.W. 1) and Nathaji (D.W. 2).\nThey filed a large number of receipts issued to them evidencing payment of rent.\nThe list of documents filed by them are printed on pages 394 to 395 of the paper book and have been marked as Exts. 237 and 239.\n12 receipts in the list Ext.\n237 are for the period 1.6.1946 to 30.5.1949 and 7 of the list Ext.\n239 are from 1.1.1947 to 30.9.1949.\nThey support the case of Chandrakanta inasmuch as on the top of these receipts are printed the following words: \" CHAWL OF BAI CHANDRAKANTA THE WIFE OF MODI JAYANTILAL BAPALAL\" Out of them the receipts Exts.\n240 to 243 were admittedly issued when the defendant No. 1 was incharge of collection of rent and it is not denied that they were issued at his instance during the crucial period.\nThe other receipt Ext.\n250 was issued for the period 1.6.1947 to 1.7.1947 under the signature of the plaintiff Vadilal and this also similarly carried the description of the chawl as belonging to Chan drakanta.\nNo explanation is forthcoming on behalf of either the defendant No. 1 or the plaintiff as to how they were issuing receipts of the above description.\n241 11.\nFrom the evidence it appears that although defendant No. 1 was in charge of the management of the chawl during 1946 to 1952, the actual collection from the individual tenants was made by the Jamadar (caretaker) who generally signed the receipts and handed over the collected amount to the defendant No. 1.\nThe tenant Nathaji (D.W. 2) has said that Maganji Jamadar used to prepare the receipts.\nIt has been argued before us on behalf of the plaintiff that the receipts were filed after the examination of the plaintiff was over and so he could not explain the same, specially the one receipt issued under his signature.\nIt is significant to note that the cases of the plaintiff, the defendant No. 1 and the other defendants excepting defendants 6 to 12 are common so far the Naroda chawl was concerned and the turn of these defendants leading evidence at the trial of the suit came later.\nThe evidence of Chandrakanta was closed on 29.9.1964 and the witnesses for the defendant No. 1 were examined on 20.10.1964.\nBesides, the plaintiff could have re examined himself if he had any explanation to offer.\nThe cross examination of D.W. 2 on his behalf also indicates that no suggestion to the witness by way of explanation was made.\nIn his evidence plaintiff stated that he was also collecting the rent from the different tenants in chawl at the instance of defendant No. 1 and he used to hand over the collections to him.\nHe admitted the fact that there were counter foils which ramained with the defendant No. 1.\nThe High Court while examining this aspect accepted and relied on Ext.\n250 signed by the plaintiff, but failed to appreci ate the significance of the description of the Naroda chawl on the receipt as the property of the defendant No. 6.\nSimilar is the position of the defendant No. 1 who did not come to the witness box at all.\nChandrakanta examined her self as D.W. 3 and supported her case.\nAlthough there are some minor discrepancies in her deposition, the same is consistent with the documents and the circumstances in the case and appears to be reliable.\nWhile reversing the finding of the trial court that Chandrakanta was in exclusive possession of the chawl not only from 1952 onwards but even earlier since 1946, the High Court was mainly impressed by three items of the evidence, namely, i)certain account books claimed to be the books at the joint family, ii) several IncomeTax returns filed by the defendant No. 1, and iii) a document of agreement, Ext.\nSo far the Income Tax papers are concerned, they are of the period after 1952 and it has already been stated earlier that the High Court has agreed with the trial court that since 1952 the defendant No. 6 was in adverse possession of the chawl.\nIn view of this finding, with which we fully agree, the Income Tax documents do not 242 have any impact, except showing that the author of these returns was falsely including income therein which did not accrue to the family.\nSo far the account books and the deed of agreement are concerned, it will be necessary or appreci ating their true nature and impact on this case, to consider some more facts.\nThe account books were produced by the defendant No. 1 within a list of documents, Ext. 123.\nThe defendant No. 1, however, did not lead any evidence with respect to the same when his turn at the trial came.\nAs mentioned earlier, he personally avoided the witness box, but examined some wit nesses who did not attempt either to prove the books or speak about their authenticity.\nThe books were admitted in evidence and marked as exhibits on the statement of the plaintiff which he made in cross examination.\nSome of the books were shown to him and he admitted that they were in his hand writing, but immediately added; \"I have written them as per the instructions of defendant No. 1 and as directed by him.\nThey are maintained from month to month.\n\" The income from the Naroda chawl which was admittedly very small as compared to the vastness and the present value of the property, was included in the account books.\nAccording to the case of the respondent the books are authentic, and disclosed the true state of affairs.\nThere was considerable discussion at the bar before us as well as before the High Court as is apparent from the judgment under appeal, relat ing to the law of evidence dealing with account books.\nReliance was placed on Sec.\n34 of the which provides that entries in books of account regularly kept in the course of business are relevant whenever they refer to a matter into which the Court has to enquire.\nIt has been contended on behalf of the respondents that since the plaintiff stated that the books were being maintained from month to month the requirement of law was satisfied.\nMr. Mehta, the learned counsel for the appellant argued that apart from the formal proof of the execution of the docu ment, the party relying thereon was under a duty to lead evidence in support of the correctness of the entries in the books which is completely lacking here.\nBesides, it was pointed out that the relevant books are merely joint khata bahis of Samvat 2005 to 2006 equivalent to 1948 to 1949 without the support of primary evidence of the cash books.\n, ,The other relevant documents which are admittedly in pos session of the defendant No. 1 have not been produced, including the account books of other years during the cru cial 243 period, the Income tax returns and assessment orders for the period 1946 to 1952 and the counter foil rent receipts.\nIt is apparent from the evidence that nobody takes the responsibility of supporting the correctness of the entries in the account books.\nWhen they were produced in Court the plaintiff filed his objection as per his purshis, Ext. 172 (page 368 of the paper book).\nMany of the documents produced by the defendant No. 1 were accepted, but the account books which were serial nos.\n123 75 to 123 97 of the list Ext.\n123 were in express terms not admitted.\nThe plain tiff said that they might be exhibited, but subject to his objection.\nThe defendant No. 6 also filed her objection as per the purshis Ext.\nThe plaintiff did not make any statement supporting the books in his examination in chief and only in reply to the question of the cross examining lawyer of the defendant No. 1, he stated as mentioned earli er.\nIt is significant to note that by saying that he had written as per the instructions of the defendant No. 1 he made it clear that he could not vouchsafe for their reli ability.\nIn spite of this situation, the defendant No. 1 could not sommon courage to support them either personally or through any witness.\nNo reason has been suggested at all on his behalf as to why he did not produce the other impor tant documents in his possession which would have supported the account books and the joint case of the parties resist ing the appellants ' claim.\nIn view of all these circum stances we have no hesitation in rejecting the account books as not reliable.\nSo far Ext.\n167 is concerned, the High Court has relied upon it as the Naroda chawl has been treated by the document as belonging to the joint family.\nIt was executed on 24.10.1954 by the plaintiff and his three brothers but not by Jayantilal, the husband of defendant No. 6, although he is also shown as a party thereto.\nThe brothers appear to have settled their dispute with respect to different items of property and the disputed Naroda chawl is shown as the seventh item in the list of properties.\nAlthough the four brothers personally signed the document, so far Jayantilal 's branch was concerned the signature of Narendra, defendant No. 7, who was a minor then, was taken.\nReliance has been placed on the attestation of Bapalal, the father of the executants.\nTwo days earlier, i.e., on 22.10.1954, he had executed a release deed, Ext.\n222 giving up his right in the family properties for a sum of money named therein.\nHe was already staying in Vrindavan for sometime past and proposed to spend the rest of his life there.\nThe release deed, however, did not contain any list of properties and the document, therefore, is not of any help to either side.\nSOl far the 244 agreement Ext.\n167 is concerned, it has not been stated by anybody that Bapalal went through its contents or that somebody read the same to him before he attested it.\nThere is no presumption that an attesting witness of a document must be assumed to be aware of its contents.\nWhat is signif icant, however, is that it was executed in 1954 when the defendant No. 6 was in adverse possession to the exclusion of the defendant No. 1 and the other members of the family, and Jayantilal did not join the document and his brothers chose to get the signature of his minor son.\nThis is con sistent with their dishonest attempt to include the income from the chawl in the Income Tax returns of the period after 1952, when the defendant No. 6 undoubtedly was in exclusive possession.\nAs has been stated earlier, in 1952 there was a direct confrontation between them on the one hand and the defendant No. 6 on the other, when public notices were published in 'Sandesh '.\nIf their case about their earlier possession had been true they would have produced their Income Tax returns and the assessment orders of that period, i.e. 1946 to 1952.\nThe family was possessed of vast proper ties and was paying Income Tax.\nThe entire circumstances lead to the irresistible conclusion that after the defendant No. 1 was removed by the defendant No. 6 from the management of the disputed Naroda chawl he and the other members of the family started creating evidence in support of their false claim.\nWe do not in the circumstances place any reliance on this deed of agreement.\nSo far the oral evidence in the case is concerned, the plaintiff, Vadilal examined himself as a witness, but was not supported by any other member of the family, al though his brothers, Gulabchand and Kantilal, defendants 1 and 2 respectively, were alive when the case was heard in the trial court.\nEven his nephew, Rajnikant, defendant No. 5, son of deceased Ramanlal did not prefer to come to the witness box.\nThe husband of the defendant No. 6, Jayantilal had died in 1956, i.e., about 3 4 years before the institu tion of the suit.\nChandrakanta examined herself in support of her case and was cross examined at considerable length.\nHer son, Narendra defendant No. 7, who was minor in 1954 when Ext.\n167 was executed, was also examined as a witness.\nAfter the death of his father, Jayantilal in 1956, he start ed collecting the rent of the chawl, and as stated earlier both the courts have concurrently held in favour of the exclusive possession of the defendant No. 6 from 1952 on wards.\nThe plaintiff, however, claimed that the chawl was in the possession of the family even later than 1952.\nWe have been taken through his evidence and the evidence of Chandra kanta in extenso by the learned counsel for the parties, who made long comments thereon during their arguments.\nBoth the judg 245 ments of the trial court and the High Court have discussed the evidence at length and we do not consider it necessary to once more deal with them in detail.\nWe agree with the reasons given by the trial court for accepting the case and the evidence of the defendant No. 6 and rejecting the plain tiff 's oral evidence and the case of the respondents.\nThe plaintiff contradicted himself so seriously during his examination that at one stage he had to expressly admit that several of the statements made in his examination in chief were 'false ' (see paragraph 25).\nIt was demonstrated by the further cross examination that he had made many more incor rect statements.\nOn the other hand, Chandrakanta 's evidence is far superior.\nAlthough she also made some inconsistent statements, but the discrepancies did not relate to any matter of vital importance.\nHer evidence substantially is reliable and is supported by important circumstances of (i) the mutation of her name in place of Bapalal on the basis of a statement of the latter; (ii) the description of the chawl as belonging to her on the printed rent receipts given to the tenants out of which some were issued by the defendant No. 1 and the plaintiff, and (iii) the suppression of vital materials in possession of the defendant No. 1 which were withheld from the Court.\nThe conduct of the parties in not filing the suit before 1960 is also consistent with the correctness of her case.\nWhen the defendant No. 1 was effec tively removed from the management of the property by the defendant No. 6 in 1952, Bapalal was alive.\nThe defendant No. 1 as also the other members of the family contesting her claim kept quiet and did not risk starting a litigation during his life time.\nEven in 1960 it was the plaintiff and not the defendant No. 1 who instituted the present suit in which he included the Naroda chawl in the schedule of properties to be partitioned.\nThe defendant No. 1 was manag ing the affairs of the family, but did not take any steps to dislodge the defendant No. 6 from the chawl.\nThe impugned judgment indicates that there were serious differences between the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1 on other items of property and the main reason for the plaintiff to file the suit does not appear to be his claim to the Naroda chawl.\nWe do not consider it necessary to reiterate the other reasons given in the trial court judgment in support of the decision in favour of the appellant, with which we agree.\nWe, therefore, hold that the defendant No. 6 remained in exclusive adverse possession of the disputed Naroda chawl right from 1946 onwards till the suit was filed in 1960.\nMr. Dholakia, the learned counsel for the contesting respondents contended that since the chawl has remained in actual possession of the tenants, Bapalal or the family must be held to be in symbolic 246 possession in 1946 and for that reason the defendant No. 6 also can not be treated to have come in actual possession of the property, which could have permitted her to prescribe a title in the chawl.\nThe learned counsel further argued that since the defendant No. 1 and the plaintiff were actually collecting rent from the tenants they also must be held to be in joint possession and, therefore, the defendant no. 6 can not succeed as she has not been able to prove their ouster.\nThe other members of the joint family will also be entitled to rely on this aspect so as to successfully defend their right.\nReliance was placed on the decision of the Patna High Court in Hari Prasad Agarwalla and another vs Abdul Haq and others, A.I.R. 1951 Patna 160; in support of the argument that for adverse possession actual physical possession is necessary and mere constructive possession is not sufficient.\nWe are afraid, it is not possible to accept the argument.\nThe subject matter of dispute in the present case is the title to the chawl as the owner landlord subject to the tenancy of the tenants in possession.\nNeither the plaintiffs nor the defendants are claiming the actual physical posses sion of the chawl by eviction of the tenants.\nAny reference to the actual physical possession of the tenant is, there fore, wholly irrelevant for the purpose of the present controversy.\nIt has to be remembered that the title to the chawl as owner, subject to the tenancy was an interest in immovable property so as to be covered by Article 144 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908, which specifically mentioned,\" . or any interest therein\".\nThese words were retained in Article 65 of the new Limitation Act.\nIt is true that it is the intention to claim exclusive title which makes possession adverse and this animus possidendi must be evidenced and effectuated by the manner of occupancy which again depends upon the nature of the property.\nThe manner of possession depends upon the kind of possession which the particular property is susceptible.\nThat possession to the extent to which it is capable of demonstration must be hostile and exclusive and will cover only to the extent of the owner 's possession.\nIn the present case the parties have been fighting for the rent from the chawl so long as it continues in possession of the tenants.\nBefore the gift of 1946 the defendant No. 1 was collecting the rent and he continued to do so even thereafter till 1952.\nThe appellant has, however, established her case that the defendant No. 1 acted as her agent after 1946 and when he repudiated this agency in 1952 he was effectively removed from the manage ment of the chawl.\nSince 1946 the tenants attorned to the defendant No. 6 and paid rent to her under printed receipts announcing her ownership, but of course through her agent the defendant No. 1.\nThe actual physical possession of the tenants in 247 the circumstances would enable the appellant to establish her prescriptive title.\nThe decision in Uppalapati Veera Venkata Satyanarayanaraju and another vs Josyula Hanumayamma and another, , indicates that if a tenant makes an attornment in favour of a person who is not the true owner and follows and paying the rent to him, such a person must be held to have effective possession.\nThe land lord must be deemed to be in possession through his tenant is also demonstrated by another illustration.\nIf the tenant trespasses over the neighbour 's land treating it to be covered by his tenancy and remains in possession for the requisite period so as to prescribe a title thereto, his interest therein is limited to the interest of the tenant and his landlord acquires the title of the owner.\nThe con duct of such a tenant has been aptly described as stealing for the landlord (see I.L.R. 10 Calcutta 820 and The fact that the tenants have been in actual physical possession of the chawl is, in the circumstances, of no assistance to the respondents.\nWhat is material is that they paid the rent to the defendant No. 6. 19.\nThere is no merit in the further argument that the defendant No. 1 must be treated to be in joint possession as he was actually collecting the rent from the tenants.\nIt is well settled that the possession of the agent is the posses sion of the principal and in view of the fiduciary relation ship the defendant No. 1 cannot be permitted to claim his own possession.\nThis aspect was well emphasised in David Lyeii vs John Lawson Kennedy, [1889] XIV H.L. (E) 437, where the agent who was collecting the rent from the tenants on behalf of the owner and depositing it in a separate ear marked account continued to do so even after the death of the owner.\nAfter more than 12 years of the owner 's death his heir 's assignee brought the action against the agent for possession and the agent defendant pleaded adverse posses sion and limitation.\nThe plaintiff succeeded in the first court.\nBut the action was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe House of Lords reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal and remarked: \"For whom, and on whose behalf, were those rents received after Ann Duncan 's death? Not by the respondent for himself, or on his own behalf, anymore than during her life time\".\nEmphasing the fiduciary character of the agent his possession was likened to that of trustee, a solicitor or an agent receiving the rent under a power of attorney.\nAnother English case of Williams vs Pott, L.R. XII Equity Cases 149, arising out of the circumstances similar to the present case was more interesting.\nThe agent in that case was the real owner of the estate but he collected the rents for a considerably long period as the agent of his principal who was his mother.\nAfter the agent 's death his heir claimed the estate.\n248 The mother (the principal) had also by then died after purporting by her will to devise the disputed lands to the defendants upon certain trusts.\nThe claim of the plaintiff was dismissed on the plea of adverse possession.\nLord Romil ly, M.R., in his judgment observed that since the possession of the agent was the possession of the principal, the agent could not have made an entry as long as he was in the posi tion of the agent or his mother, and that he could not get into possession without first resigning his position as her agent which he could have done by saying: \"The property is mine; I claim the rents, and I shall apply the rents for my own purposes\".\nThe agent had thus lost his title by reason of his own possession as agent of the principal.\nA similar situation arose in Secretary of State for India vs Krishna moni Gupta, 29 Indian Appeals 104, a case between lessor and lessee.\nThere the proprietors of the land in dispute, Mozum dars were in actual physical possession but after getting a settlement from the Government in ignorance of their title.\nThe Government contended that the possession of the Mozum dars was, in circumstances, the possession of the Government claiming the proprietory right in the disputed land and that such possession was in exclusion and adverse to the claim of the Mozumdars to be proprietors thereof.\nThe plea succeeded.\nIt was observed by the Judicial Committee.\n\"It may at first sight seem singular that parties should be barred by lapse of time during which they were in physical possession, and estopped from disputing the title of the Government.\nBut there is no doubt that the possession of the tenant is in law the posses sion of the landlord or superior proprietor, and it can make no difference whether the tenant be one who might claim adversely to his landlord or not.\nIndeed, in such a case it may be thought that the adverse character of the possession is placed beyond controversy.\n\" We are, therefore, of the view that the defendant No. 6 was in adverse possession from the period 1946 to 1952 through her agent defendant No. 1 and thereafter through her husband, Jayantilal and son, defendant No. 7 till 1960 when the suit was filed, the total period being more than 12 years.\nFor the reasons mentioned above, the decision of the High Court must be held to be erroneous.\nConsequently the decrees for accounts against the defendants No. 6 and 7 must also go.\nAccordingly, the appeals are allowed, the decision of the High Court, so far 249 the subject matter of the present appeals is concerned, is set aside and that of the trial court restored.\nIn view of the close relationship of the parties and the other circum stances, the parties are directed to bear their own costs throughout.\nN.V.K.

    "main_content": "ivil Appeal Nos. 410 and 520(N) of 1973.\nFrom the Judgment and Decree dated 21/22/23.11.1972 of the Gujarat High Court in First Appeal Nos. 454 and 455 of 1970.\nB.K.

Javeri, for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHARMA, J.\nThese appeals are directed against the deci sion of the Gujarat High Court in an appeal arising out of a suit for partition instituted by the respondent No. 1, Vadilal Bapalal Modi (since deceased).\nThe father of the plaintiff Vadilal was Bapalal who had 5 sons the plaintiff, Ramanlal, Gulabchand, Kantilal and Jayantilal; and a daughter Champaben.\nGulabchand was impleaded as the first defendant in the suit and on his death his heirs and legal representatives have been substi tuted.\nKantilal and Champaben are defendants No. 2 and 3 respectively.\nRamanlal predeceased Bapalal and his wife and son are defendants No. 4 and 5.\nJayantilal also died earlier and his wife Smt.\nChandrakantaben, defendant No. 6 is the appellant in Civil Appeal No. 418 of 1973.\nTheir children are defendants No. 7 to 12.\nCiviI Appeal No. 520 of 1973 has been preferred by the 7th defendant, Narendra.\nThe suit by VadilaI was instituted in 1960, claiming share in the considerably large properties detailed in the Schedule to the plaint, but the present appeals are not related to any other item excepting the property described as a chawl admeasuring 7 acres and 2 gunthas of land with 115 rooms and huts, situated in the Naroda locality in Ahmedabad under Lot No. 8 of the plaint which has been referred to by the counsel for the parties before us as the chawl or the Naroda chawl.\nAccording to the case of the defendants No. 6 to 12, this property exclusively belongs to defendant No. 6 and is not liable to partition.\nThe other defendants contested the claim of the plaintiff with respect to some other items, but so far the disputed chawl is con cerned, they supported the plaintiffs ' case that it belonged to the joint family and is liable to partition.\nThe land of Lot No. 8 was acquired by Bapalal in 1932 for a sum of Rs.9,450 and the rooms were constructed thereon in about 1934.\nIt has been held by the High Court, and the finding has not been challenged before us, that Bapalal acquired the property and built the chawl with the aid of ancestral joint funds, and the property, therefore, belonged to the family.\nAccording to the case of the defendants 237 No. 6 to 12, Bapalal orally gifted the property to his daughter in law Chandrakanta the 6th defendant, in March, 1946 and made a statement before the Revenue authorities on the basis of which her name was mutated, and she was put in possession thereof.\nAdmittedly 114 rooms in the Naroda chawl had been let out to tenants, and one room was retained for the caretaker.\nAccording to Chandrakanta 's case, although she came in peaceful possession, the management which in cluded realisation of rent was in the hands of Gulabchand (defendant No. 1).\nIt appears that in 1952 some dispute arose and Chandrakanta assumed direct charge of the Naroda chawl and has remained in possession thereafter.\nThus she has been in exclusive possession of the disputed chawl since 1946, and acquired good title therein by adverse possession before the suit was filed in 1960.\nThe learned Judge, City Civil Court, Ahmedabad, who tried the suit, held that BapalaI and his sons constituted a joint Hindu family and the business carried on by Bapalal was for the benefit of the family and the income from the business was thrown in the common pool and all the proper ties including the disputed chawl were treated as belonging to the family.\nProceeding further it has been found that the case of the defendant No. 6 about the gift, the mutation of her name, and her exclusive possession from 1946 till the date of the suit was correct.\nShe was accordingly held to have acquired a title by adverse possession.\nThe suit, therefore, was dismissed with respect to the disputed chawl.\nFor the purpose of the present appeal it is not essential to mention the findings of the trial court relating to the other items of the suit property.\nThe plaintiff appealed before the Gujarat High Court.\nSome of the defendants also filed two separate appeals against the judgment of the trial court dealing with other items of property with which we are not concerned.\nThe appeals were heard and disposed of to gether by a common judgment in November 1972.\nThe High Court reversed the finding of adverse possession in regard to the disputed chawl and granted a decree for partition.\nIt was held that the defendant No. 6 remained in exclusive posses sion of the property only since 1952 and the period was thus short of the time required for prescription of title.\nDeal ing with the relief for rendition of accounts, the Court held that since the rents of the chawl from 1952 were col lected by Jayantilal, Chandrakanta 's husband and after his death by her son Narendra (defendant No. 7), Chandrakanta was liable to render accounts till the death of her husband and she along with defendant No. 7 would be jointly liable for the period thereafter.\nThe present appeals are directed against this judgment.\n238 5.\nAccording to the case of the defendant No. 6, her husband, Jayantilal, used to indulge in speculative business and he was, therefore, not considered a dependable person.\nTo ensure economic stability of Chandrakanta and her chil dren, her father in law, Bapalal decided to make a gift of the Naroda chawl to her.\nBoth Bapalal and Chandrakanta appeared before the Talati of Naroda on 5.3.1946 and made statements.\nThe original statement of Bapalal recorded by the Talati and signed by Bapalal was produced and marked as Ext.\n268 in the trial court and similarly the statement of Chandrakanta as Ext.\nBapalal has stated in Ext.\n268 that Chandrakanta had loyally served him and, therefore, he was making the gift.\nA prayer was made for substitution of her name in the revenue records.\nA similar prayer was made by the lady in Ext.\nThe extract from the Record of Rights is Ext.\n247 which mentions Bapalal as the occupant of the Naroda chawl.\nThe entry was made in May 1933.\nThis entry appears to have been placed within brackets and a second entry inserted mentioning Chandrakanta 'wife of Jayantilal Bapalal '.\nMr. B.K. Mehta, the learned counsel for the appel lant has strongly relied upon the revenue entry as proof of her title.\nReference was made to the decision in Gangabai and others vs Fakirgowda Somaypagowda Desai and others, A.I.R. 1930 Privy Council 93; and Desai Navinkant Kesarlal vs Prabhat Kabhai, 9 Gujarat Law Reporter 694.\nIt was point ed out by the learned counsel that in the Privy Council case also the revenue records, which were under consideration, were prepared under the Bombay Land Revenue Code, that is the same Code under which Ext.\n247 was prepared and it was observed in the judgment that the revenue entry furnished presumptive evidence of title.\nThe Gujarat case also indi cated that a presumption as to the rights in the concerned property arose in favour of the person whose name was en tered.\nWe are not very much impressed by this part of argu ment of the learned counsel as it cannot be denied that title to Naroda chawl could not have passed to the defendant No. 6 by virtue of the entry Ext.\nThe value of the chawl even in 1946 was large and no registered instrument of transfer was executed.\nBesides Ext.\n247 describes Bapalal and thereafter Chandrakanta as Kabjedar, that is, occupant.\nIn these circumstances the presumption which can be raised in favour of Chandrakanta from this entry is with respect to her possession and possession only.\nThere is a serious dispute between the parties as to the actual physical possession of the chawl during the period 1946 to 1952 and we will have to consider the evi dence on this aspect in some detail.\nIn 1952 there was direct confrontation between Chandrakanta and the defendant No. 1, Gulabchand.\nOn 14.4.1952 a public notice was 239 published in a local daily named 'Sandesh ' vide Ext.\n254 wherein Gulabchand informed and called upon the tenants in the chawl to pay the rent to him within 3 days against receipts to be issued, failing which legal steps would be taken against them.\nOn the very next day 'Sandesh ' carried another public notice Ext.\n255 issued by Chandrakanta as serting her title and exclusive possession and repudiating the claim of Gulabchand.\nThe tenants were warned that Gulab chand or any other person on his behalf had no right or authority to dispute her claim.\nOn the same day, i.e., on 15.4.1952 another public notice was published in 'Sandesh ' at the instance of Gulabchand reiterating his claim and asserting that his father Bapalal (who was then alive) was the owner.\nIt appears that no further action was taken by any of the parties.\nThe evidence on the record shows that Bapalal had withdrawn himself from wordly affairs and was staying in Vrindavan near Mathura.\nThe evidence led by Chandrakanta of her exclusive possession from 1952 through her husband and son till the date of the suit was accepted as reliable by the High Court.\nThus there is concurrent finding of both the two courts below accepting her exclusive possession from 1952 onwards.\nThe learned counsel for the plaintiff has, therefore, rightly not challenged before us this finding which we are independently also satisfied is a correct one.\nThe actual position of the chawl from 1946 to 1952 becomes crucial, as Chandrakanta is bound to fail if she is not successful in proving her adverse possession for this period.\nAs has been stated earlier, the suit was filed in 1960 and her possession since 1952 cannot be treated long enough for a prescriptive title to accrue.\nThe parties have, therefore, taken great pains to prove before us their rival cases as to the possession of the chawl from 1946 to 1952.\nThe defendant No. 1 was admittedly managing the properties belonging to the family.\nOut of 115 rooms in Naroda chawl only 114 were let out to tenants and one room was retained in which, according to the case of Chandrakan ta, a caretaker known as Gangia Pathan, engaged by Bapalal, was staying.\nAfter collecting the rent from the tenants the Pathan used to hand over the money to the defendant No. 1.\nAfter the gift, it was decided that the same arrangement would continue but the defendant No. 1 would be managing the property on her behalf and after receipt of the rent he would deliver the same to her.\nShe claims that this arrange ment was acted upon.\nAdmittedly the total rent collection from the chawl was not large and after deducting the ex penses including the maintenance and repair costs and the salary of the Jamadar (caretaker) the money left was not a considerable sum.\n240 According to the evidence of Chandrakanta the Pathan left the service and his whereabouts are not known and another Jamadar with the name of Maganji came in his place.\nHe looked after the chawl till 1950.\nThereafter he was substi tuted by Nathu Singh.\nMaganji 's present whereabouts are also not known.\nIn 1952 Gulabchand made a claim to the chawl repudiating the ownership of Chandrakanta and he was, there fore, removed.\nThe appellant has relied on a large number of rent receipts filed by her and her learned counsel laid great stress on five of them which have been marked as Exts.\n240 to 243 and 250 issued in December 1947, January 1948, June 1948 April 1949 and July 1947 respectively.\nIt is signifi cant to note that the defendant No. 1 was in charge of the collection of the rent upto 1952 according to the case of all the parties.\nThe parties contesting the claim of the appellant contend that he was so doing on behalf of the entire family and not on behalf of Chandrakanta as claimed by her.\nThe defendant No. 1, however, did not choose to enter the witness box nor did he produce any document which could have supported his case.\nThe counter foil receipts were in his possession and neither they were filed by the defendant No. 1 nor the plaintiff called for the same.\nDefendant No. 6 was able to examine two of the tenants Vajesingh (D.W. 1) and Nathaji (D.W. 2).\nThey filed a large number of receipts issued to them evidencing payment of rent.\nThe list of documents filed by them are printed on pages 394 to 395 of the paper book and have been marked as Exts. 237 and 239.\n12 receipts in the list Ext.\n237 are for the period 1.6.1946 to 30.5.1949 and 7 of the list Ext.\n239 are from 1.1.1947 to 30.9.1949.\nThey support the case of Chandrakanta inasmuch as on the top of these receipts are printed the following words: \" CHAWL OF BAI CHANDRAKANTA THE WIFE OF MODI JAYANTILAL BAPALAL\" Out of them the receipts Exts.\n240 to 243 were admittedly issued when the defendant No. 1 was incharge of collection of rent and it is not denied that they were issued at his instance during the crucial period.\nThe other receipt Ext.\n250 was issued for the period 1.6.1947 to 1.7.1947 under the signature of the plaintiff Vadilal and this also similarly carried the description of the chawl as belonging to Chan drakanta.\nNo explanation is forthcoming on behalf of either the defendant No. 1 or the plaintiff as to how they were issuing receipts of the above description.\n241 11.\nFrom the evidence it appears that although defendant No. 1 was in charge of the management of the chawl during 1946 to 1952, the actual collection from the individual tenants was made by the Jamadar (caretaker) who generally signed the receipts and handed over the collected amount to the defendant No. 1.\nThe tenant Nathaji (D.W. 2) has said that Maganji Jamadar used to prepare the receipts.\nIt has been argued before us on behalf of the plaintiff that the receipts were filed after the examination of the plaintiff was over and so he could not explain the same, specially the one receipt issued under his signature.\nIt is significant to note that the cases of the plaintiff, the defendant No. 1 and the other defendants excepting defendants 6 to 12 are common so far the Naroda chawl was concerned and the turn of these defendants leading evidence at the trial of the suit came later.\nThe evidence of Chandrakanta was closed on 29.9.1964 and the witnesses for the defendant No. 1 were examined on 20.10.1964.\nBesides, the plaintiff could have re examined himself if he had any explanation to offer.\nThe cross examination of D.W. 2 on his behalf also indicates that no suggestion to the witness by way of explanation was made.\nIn his evidence plaintiff stated that he was also collecting the rent from the different tenants in chawl at the instance of defendant No. 1 and he used to hand over the collections to him.\nHe admitted the fact that there were counter foils which ramained with the defendant No. 1.\nThe High Court while examining this aspect accepted and relied on Ext.\n250 signed by the plaintiff, but failed to appreci ate the significance of the description of the Naroda chawl on the receipt as the property of the defendant No. 6.\nSimilar is the position of the defendant No. 1 who did not come to the witness box at all.\nChandrakanta examined her self as D.W. 3 and supported her case.\nAlthough there are some minor discrepancies in her deposition, the same is consistent with the documents and the circumstances in the case and appears to be reliable.\nWhile reversing the finding of the trial court that Chandrakanta was in exclusive possession of the chawl not only from 1952 onwards but even earlier since 1946, the High Court was mainly impressed by three items of the evidence, namely, i)certain account books claimed to be the books at the joint family, ii) several IncomeTax returns filed by the defendant No. 1, and iii) a document of agreement, Ext.\nSo far the Income Tax papers are concerned, they are of the period after 1952 and it has already been stated earlier that the High Court has agreed with the trial court that since 1952 the defendant No. 6 was in adverse possession of the chawl.\nIn view of this finding, with which we fully agree, the Income Tax documents do not 242 have any impact, except showing that the author of these returns was falsely including income therein which did not accrue to the family.\nSo far the account books and the deed of agreement are concerned, it will be necessary or appreci ating their true nature and impact on this case, to consider some more facts.\nThe account books were produced by the defendant No. 1 within a list of documents, Ext. 123.\nThe defendant No. 1, however, did not lead any evidence with respect to the same when his turn at the trial came.\nAs mentioned earlier, he personally avoided the witness box, but examined some wit nesses who did not attempt either to prove the books or speak about their authenticity.\nThe books were admitted in evidence and marked as exhibits on the statement of the plaintiff which he made in cross examination.\nSome of the books were shown to him and he admitted that they were in his hand writing, but immediately added; \"I have written them as per the instructions of defendant No. 1 and as directed by him.\nThey are maintained from month to month.\n\" The income from the Naroda chawl which was admittedly very small as compared to the vastness and the present value of the property, was included in the account books.\nAccording to the case of the respondent the books are authentic, and disclosed the true state of affairs.\nThere was considerable discussion at the bar before us as well as before the High Court as is apparent from the judgment under appeal, relat ing to the law of evidence dealing with account books.\nReliance was placed on Sec.\n34 of the which provides that entries in books of account regularly kept in the course of business are relevant whenever they refer to a matter into which the Court has to enquire.\nIt has been contended on behalf of the respondents that since the plaintiff stated that the books were being maintained from month to month the requirement of law was satisfied.\nMr. Mehta, the learned counsel for the appellant argued that apart from the formal proof of the execution of the docu ment, the party relying thereon was under a duty to lead evidence in support of the correctness of the entries in the books which is completely lacking here.\nBesides, it was pointed out that the relevant books are merely joint khata bahis of Samvat 2005 to 2006 equivalent to 1948 to 1949 without the support of primary evidence of the cash books.\n, ,The other relevant documents which are admittedly in pos session of the defendant No. 1 have not been produced, including the account books of other years during the cru cial 243 period, the Income tax returns and assessment orders for the period 1946 to 1952 and the counter foil rent receipts.\nIt is apparent from the evidence that nobody takes the responsibility of supporting the correctness of the entries in the account books.\nWhen they were produced in Court the plaintiff filed his objection as per his purshis, Ext. 172 (page 368 of the paper book).\nMany of the documents produced by the defendant No. 1 were accepted, but the account books which were serial nos.\n123 75 to 123 97 of the list Ext.\n123 were in express terms not admitted.\nThe plain tiff said that they might be exhibited, but subject to his objection.\nThe defendant No. 6 also filed her objection as per the purshis Ext.\nThe plaintiff did not make any statement supporting the books in his examination in chief and only in reply to the question of the cross examining lawyer of the defendant No. 1, he stated as mentioned earli er.\nIt is significant to note that by saying that he had written as per the instructions of the defendant No. 1 he made it clear that he could not vouchsafe for their reli ability.\nIn spite of this situation, the defendant No. 1 could not sommon courage to support them either personally or through any witness.\nNo reason has been suggested at all on his behalf as to why he did not produce the other impor tant documents in his possession which would have supported the account books and the joint case of the parties resist ing the appellants ' claim.\nIn view of all these circum stances we have no hesitation in rejecting the account books as not reliable.\nSo far Ext.\n167 is concerned, the High Court has relied upon it as the Naroda chawl has been treated by the document as belonging to the joint family.\nIt was executed on 24.10.1954 by the plaintiff and his three brothers but not by Jayantilal, the husband of defendant No. 6, although he is also shown as a party thereto.\nThe brothers appear to have settled their dispute with respect to different items of property and the disputed Naroda chawl is shown as the seventh item in the list of properties.\nAlthough the four brothers personally signed the document, so far Jayantilal 's branch was concerned the signature of Narendra, defendant No. 7, who was a minor then, was taken.\nReliance has been placed on the attestation of Bapalal, the father of the executants.\nTwo days earlier, i.e., on 22.10.1954, he had executed a release deed, Ext.\n222 giving up his right in the family properties for a sum of money named therein.\nHe was already staying in Vrindavan for sometime past and proposed to spend the rest of his life there.\nThe release deed, however, did not contain any list of properties and the document, therefore, is not of any help to either side.\nSOl far the 244 agreement Ext.\n167 is concerned, it has not been stated by anybody that Bapalal went through its contents or that somebody read the same to him before he attested it.\nThere is no presumption that an attesting witness of a document must be assumed to be aware of its contents.\nWhat is signif icant, however, is that it was executed in 1954 when the defendant No. 6 was in adverse possession to the exclusion of the defendant No. 1 and the other members of the family, and Jayantilal did not join the document and his brothers chose to get the signature of his minor son.\nThis is con sistent with their dishonest attempt to include the income from the chawl in the Income Tax returns of the period after 1952, when the defendant No. 6 undoubtedly was in exclusive possession.\nAs has been stated earlier, in 1952 there was a direct confrontation between them on the one hand and the defendant No. 6 on the other, when public notices were published in 'Sandesh '.\nIf their case about their earlier possession had been true they would have produced their Income Tax returns and the assessment orders of that period, i.e. 1946 to 1952.\nThe family was possessed of vast proper ties and was paying Income Tax.\nThe entire circumstances lead to the irresistible conclusion that after the defendant No. 1 was removed by the defendant No. 6 from the management of the disputed Naroda chawl he and the other members of the family started creating evidence in support of their false claim.\nWe do not in the circumstances place any reliance on this deed of agreement.\nSo far the oral evidence in the case is concerned, the plaintiff, Vadilal examined himself as a witness, but was not supported by any other member of the family, al though his brothers, Gulabchand and Kantilal, defendants 1 and 2 respectively, were alive when the case was heard in the trial court.\nEven his nephew, Rajnikant, defendant No. 5, son of deceased Ramanlal did not prefer to come to the witness box.\nThe husband of the defendant No. 6, Jayantilal had died in 1956, i.e., about 3 4 years before the institu tion of the suit.\nChandrakanta examined herself in support of her case and was cross examined at considerable length.\nHer son, Narendra defendant No. 7, who was minor in 1954 when Ext.\n167 was executed, was also examined as a witness.\nAfter the death of his father, Jayantilal in 1956, he start ed collecting the rent of the chawl, and as stated earlier both the courts have concurrently held in favour of the exclusive possession of the defendant No. 6 from 1952 on wards.\nThe plaintiff, however, claimed that the chawl was in the possession of the family even later than 1952.\nWe have been taken through his evidence and the evidence of Chandra kanta in extenso by the learned counsel for the parties, who made long comments thereon during their arguments.\nBoth the judg 245 ments of the trial court and the High Court have discussed the evidence at length and we do not consider it necessary to once more deal with them in detail.\nWe agree with the reasons given by the trial court for accepting the case and the evidence of the defendant No. 6 and rejecting the plain tiff 's oral evidence and the case of the respondents.\nThe plaintiff contradicted himself so seriously during his examination that at one stage he had to expressly admit that several of the statements made in his examination in chief were 'false ' (see paragraph 25).\nIt was demonstrated by the further cross examination that he had made many more incor rect statements.\nOn the other hand, Chandrakanta 's evidence is far superior.\nAlthough she also made some inconsistent statements, but the discrepancies did not relate to any matter of vital importance.\nHer evidence substantially is reliable and is supported by important circumstances of (i) the mutation of her name in place of Bapalal on the basis of a statement of the latter; (ii) the description of the chawl as belonging to her on the printed rent receipts given to the tenants out of which some were issued by the defendant No. 1 and the plaintiff, and (iii) the suppression of vital materials in possession of the defendant No. 1 which were withheld from the Court.\nThe conduct of the parties in not filing the suit before 1960 is also consistent with the correctness of her case.\nWhen the defendant No. 1 was effec tively removed from the management of the property by the defendant No. 6 in 1952, Bapalal was alive.\nThe defendant No. 1 as also the other members of the family contesting her claim kept quiet and did not risk starting a litigation during his life time.\nEven in 1960 it was the plaintiff and not the defendant No. 1 who instituted the present suit in which he included the Naroda chawl in the schedule of properties to be partitioned.\nThe defendant No. 1 was manag ing the affairs of the family, but did not take any steps to dislodge the defendant No. 6 from the chawl.\nThe impugned judgment indicates that there were serious differences between the plaintiff and the defendant No. 1 on other items of property and the main reason for the plaintiff to file the suit does not appear to be his claim to the Naroda chawl.\nWe do not consider it necessary to reiterate the other reasons given in the trial court judgment in support of the decision in favour of the appellant, with which we agree.\nWe, therefore, hold that the defendant No. 6 remained in exclusive adverse possession of the disputed Naroda chawl right from 1946 onwards till the suit was filed in 1960.\nMr. Dholakia, the learned counsel for the contesting respondents contended that since the chawl has remained in actual possession of the tenants, Bapalal or the family must be held to be in symbolic 246 possession in 1946 and for that reason the defendant No. 6 also can not be treated to have come in actual possession of the property, which could have permitted her to prescribe a title in the chawl.\nThe learned counsel further argued that since the defendant No. 1 and the plaintiff were actually collecting rent from the tenants they also must be held to be in joint possession and, therefore, the defendant no. 6 can not succeed as she has not been able to prove their ouster.\nThe other members of the joint family will also be entitled to rely on this aspect so as to successfully defend their right.\nReliance was placed on the decision of the Patna High Court in Hari Prasad Agarwalla and another vs Abdul Haq and others, A.I.R. 1951 Patna 160; in support of the argument that for adverse possession actual physical possession is necessary and mere constructive possession is not sufficient.\nWe are afraid, it is not possible to accept the argument.\nThe subject matter of dispute in the present case is the title to the chawl as the owner landlord subject to the tenancy of the tenants in possession.\nNeither the plaintiffs nor the defendants are claiming the actual physical posses sion of the chawl by eviction of the tenants.\nAny reference to the actual physical possession of the tenant is, there fore, wholly irrelevant for the purpose of the present controversy.\nIt has to be remembered that the title to the chawl as owner, subject to the tenancy was an interest in immovable property so as to be covered by Article 144 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908, which specifically mentioned,\" . or any interest therein\".\nThese words were retained in Article 65 of the new Limitation Act.\nIt is true that it is the intention to claim exclusive title which makes possession adverse and this animus possidendi must be evidenced and effectuated by the manner of occupancy which again depends upon the nature of the property.\nThe manner of possession depends upon the kind of possession which the particular property is susceptible.\nThat possession to the extent to which it is capable of demonstration must be hostile and exclusive and will cover only to the extent of the owner 's possession.\nIn the present case the parties have been fighting for the rent from the chawl so long as it continues in possession of the tenants.\nBefore the gift of 1946 the defendant No. 1 was collecting the rent and he continued to do so even thereafter till 1952.\nThe appellant has, however, established her case that the defendant No. 1 acted as her agent after 1946 and when he repudiated this agency in 1952 he was effectively removed from the manage ment of the chawl.\nSince 1946 the tenants attorned to the defendant No. 6 and paid rent to her under printed receipts announcing her ownership, but of course through her agent the defendant No. 1.\nThe actual physical possession of the tenants in 247 the circumstances would enable the appellant to establish her prescriptive title.\nThe decision in Uppalapati Veera Venkata Satyanarayanaraju and another vs Josyula Hanumayamma and another, , indicates that if a tenant makes an attornment in favour of a person who is not the true owner and follows and paying the rent to him, such a person must be held to have effective possession.\nThe land lord must be deemed to be in possession through his tenant is also demonstrated by another illustration.\nIf the tenant trespasses over the neighbour 's land treating it to be covered by his tenancy and remains in possession for the requisite period so as to prescribe a title thereto, his interest therein is limited to the interest of the tenant and his landlord acquires the title of the owner.\nThe con duct of such a tenant has been aptly described as stealing for the landlord (see I.L.R. 10 Calcutta 820 and The fact that the tenants have been in actual physical possession of the chawl is, in the circumstances, of no assistance to the respondents.\nWhat is material is that they paid the rent to the defendant No. 6. 19.\nThere is no merit in the further argument that the defendant No. 1 must be treated to be in joint possession as he was actually collecting the rent from the tenants.\nIt is well settled that the possession of the agent is the posses sion of the principal and in view of the fiduciary relation ship the defendant No. 1 cannot be permitted to claim his own possession.\nThis aspect was well emphasised in David Lyeii vs John Lawson Kennedy, [1889] XIV H.L. (E) 437, where the agent who was collecting the rent from the tenants on behalf of the owner and depositing it in a separate ear marked account continued to do so even after the death of the owner.\nAfter more than 12 years of the owner 's death his heir 's assignee brought the action against the agent for possession and the agent defendant pleaded adverse posses sion and limitation.\nThe plaintiff succeeded in the first court.\nBut the action was dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\nThe House of Lords reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal and remarked: \"For whom, and on whose behalf, were those rents received after Ann Duncan 's death? Not by the respondent for himself, or on his own behalf, anymore than during her life time\".\nEmphasing the fiduciary character of the agent his possession was likened to that of trustee, a solicitor or an agent receiving the rent under a power of attorney.\nAnother English case of Williams vs Pott, L.R. XII Equity Cases 149, arising out of the circumstances similar to the present case was more interesting.\nThe agent in that case was the real owner of the estate but he collected the rents for a considerably long period as the agent of his principal who was his mother.\nAfter the agent 's death his heir claimed the estate.\n248 The mother (the principal) had also by then died after purporting by her will to devise the disputed lands to the defendants upon certain trusts.\nThe claim of the plaintiff was dismissed on the plea of adverse possession.\nLord Romil ly, M.R., in his judgment observed that since the possession of the agent was the possession of the principal, the agent could not have made an entry as long as he was in the posi tion of the agent or his mother, and that he could not get into possession without first resigning his position as her agent which he could have done by saying: \"The property is mine; I claim the rents, and I shall apply the rents for my own purposes\".\nThe agent had thus lost his title by reason of his own possession as agent of the principal.\nA similar situation arose in Secretary of State for India vs Krishna moni Gupta, 29 Indian Appeals 104, a case between lessor and lessee.\nThere the proprietors of the land in dispute, Mozum dars were in actual physical possession but after getting a settlement from the Government in ignorance of their title.\nThe Government contended that the possession of the Mozum dars was, in circumstances, the possession of the Government claiming the proprietory right in the disputed land and that such possession was in exclusion and adverse to the claim of the Mozumdars to be proprietors thereof.\nThe plea succeeded.\nIt was observed by the Judicial Committee.\n\"It may at first sight seem singular that parties should be barred by lapse of time during which they were in physical possession, and estopped from disputing the title of the Government.\nBut there is no doubt that the possession of the tenant is in law the posses sion of the landlord or superior proprietor, and it can make no difference whether the tenant be one who might claim adversely to his landlord or not.\nIndeed, in such a case it may be thought that the adverse character of the possession is placed beyond controversy.\n\" We are, therefore, of the view that the defendant No. 6 was in adverse possession from the period 1946 to 1952 through her agent defendant No. 1 and thereafter through her husband, Jayantilal and son, defendant No. 7 till 1960 when the suit was filed, the total period being more than 12 years.\nFor the reasons mentioned above, the decision of the High Court must be held to be erroneous.\nConsequently the decrees for accounts against the defendants No. 6 and 7 must also go.\nAccordingly, the appeals are allowed, the decision of the High Court, so far 249 the subject matter of the present appeals is concerned, is set aside and that of the trial court restored.\nIn view of the close relationship of the parties and the other circum stances, the parties are directed to bear their own costs throughout.\nN.V.K. Appeals allowed.\n",

Mehrotra for the Respondents.\n562 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by KANIA, J.\nThis is an Appeal by Special Leave against a judgment and order dated September 15, 1982 delivered by the Allahabad High Court in Civil Miscellaneous Writ No. 14807 of 1981.\nThe appellant before us is the tenant of the shop in question.\nRespondent No. 1 is a proforma party, namely, the Prescribed Authority, and respondent No. 2 is the landlord of the building containing the shop in question, situated at Mandi Harbansganj Dhampur.\nWe propose to refer to the appel lant as the tenant and respondent No. 2 as the landlord.\nIn 1959 the landlord filed an application under section 3(1) of the U.P.

Rent Act of 1947\") for the eviction of the tenant from the said shop.\nThe said application was made on the ground that the landlord wanted to demolish the shops in the building including the said shop and in their place wanted to construct new shops and also to construct the residential portion on the first floor.\nIn the new building the accommodation would be much larger and, apart from shops, even residential premises would be constructed.\nIn paragraph 7 of the application, the landlord gave an \"assurance (undertaking that the applicant will give the new shop to the second party after the new shops are constructed on a reasonable rent.\n\" It is common ground that the applicant referred to was the landlord and the second party referred to was the tenant.\nThis applica tion was contested by the tenant along with other tenants, against whom also, the similar applications were filed.\nThe application was made to the District Magistrate within the meaning of the said expression in sub section (d) of section 2 of the U.P. Rent Act of 1947.\nThe Rent Controller and Eviction Officer who acted as District Magistrate with in the connotation of the said term under the said Act, about which there is no dispute, granted the permission and rejected the contentions of the tenant.\nIn the order grant ing the permission, which order.\nis dated February 27, 1980, the Rent Controller and Eviction Officer noted that the landlord was ready to give the newly constructed shops to the tenants on a reasonable rent.\nTaking into account all relevant facts and circumstances including the aforesaid fact of the assurance cure undertaking given by the land lord, the permission to evict the tenant was granted.\nAgainst this decision all the tenants including the tenant herein filed revision petitions which were dismissed by the Commissioner, Rukhilkand and Division, Bareilly.\nThe tenants applied by way of further revision to the State Governor under Section 7 F of the said U.P. Rant Act of 1947.\nIn disposing of the revision 563 petitions, the Special Secretary, who disposed of the same in the name of the Governor of the State of U.P., noted that the landlord had given an undertaking to the tenants that they would be given newly constructed shops on standard rent and that during the period taken for construction, alterna tive accommodation would also be given to them.\nThereafter, the landlord filed a suit on the basis of the aforesaid permission for eviction of the tenant.\nDuring the pendency of the suit, the Uttar Pradesh Urban Buildings (Regulation of Letting, Rent and Eviction) Act, 1972 (hereinafter re ferred to0 as 'the U.P. Rent Act of 1972\") came into force.\nThe U.P. Rent Act of 1947 was repealed by sub,section (1) of section 43 of the U.P. Rent Act of 1972 save and except to the extent provided in the savings clause set out at subsec tion (2) of that section.\nSome amendments were made to section 43(2) (rr) in the U.P. Rent Act of 1972 by the U .P.\nAct of XXXIII of 1976, whereby the landlords who had on the basis of the permissions granted to them under section 3(1) of the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 instituted suits for the evic tion of their tenants were given the right to apply for eviction of their tenants straightaway if the permission granted to them under section 3(1) of the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 had been obtained on any ground specified in sub,sec tion (1) or subsection (2) of section 21 of the U.P. Rent Act of 1972.\nTaking advantage of these provisions, the landlord filed an application for an order of eviction against the tenant on the ground that the permission had been obtained by the landlord on the ground specified in clause (b) of section 21(1) of the U.P. Rent Act of 1972 and hence, he was entitled to an order of eviction straightaway under section 43(2) (rr) of the U.P. Rent Act of 1972.\nThe Prescribed Authority dismissed the application of the land lord on the ground that the permission obtained by him was a conditional permission and it could not come into operation unless the landlord had complied with the offer made by him before the Rent Controller and Eviction Officer, namely, to make available to the tenant an alternative shop.\nIt was held by the Prescribed Authority that till that condition was satisfied by the landlord, he could not claim the evic tion of the tenant under section 43(2) (rr) of the U.P. Rent Act of 1972.\nAgainst this order, the landlord preferred the aforesaid writ petition which was disposed of by the learned Single Judge of the High Court by the impugned judgment.\nThe learned Judge took the view that the Prescribed Authority was bound to allow the application of the landlord under section 43(2) (rr) of the U.P. Rent Act of 1972 and order eviction.\nIt was held by the learned Judge that the ground on which permission was granted by the Rent Controller and Eviction Authorities under the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 fell within clause (b) of sub section (1) of section 21 of the U.P. 564 Rent Act of 1972 and hence, the Prescribed Authority under the Act of 1972 had no jurisdiction to embark upon any fresh enquiry as to the nature of the permission.\nIt was held by the learned Judge that the finding of the Rent Control authorities was that the building was in a dilapidated condition and required demolition and hence, the Prescribed Authority had no jurisdiction to impose any condition before granting an eviction order.\nIt was held by him that the Prescribed Authority had failed to exercise its statutory duty to order the eviction of the tenant.\nThe learned Single Judge directed the Prescribed Authority to pass an order of eviction against the tenant.\nIt is this judgment of the learned Single Judge which is impugned before us by Shri Parmod Swaroop, learned counsel for the appellant.\nLearned counsel for the appellant submitted that the decision of the prescribed Authority to decline the prayer for eviction made by respondent No. 2 was justified in view of the undertakings given by respondent No. 2 when the permission to file a suit for eviction was given under the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 and the High Court was in error in upsetting the decision of the Prescribed Authority.\nIt was, on the other hand, contended by Mr.Mehrotra, learned counsel for respondent No. 2 that in view of the provisions of section 43(2) (rr) of the U.P. Rent Act of 1972, the Pre scribed Authority had no jurisdiction to go behind the permission and was bound to give an order for eviction unconditionally as held by the High Court in its impugned judgment.\nAlthough the judgment of the Prescribed Authority, which was set aside by the High Court, is not before us, it appears clear from the impugned judgment that the Prescribed Authority took the view that the permission granted to respondent No. 2 to file the suit for eviction was a condi tional one and was operative only on the performance of the condition incorporated in the undertaking given by the landlord.\nWe are of the view that the entire argument before us proceeds to a large extent on a misapprehension.\nHowever, before dealing with the rival submissions, we propose to refer to the relevant provisions of the aforestated two Acts very briefly.\nU.P. Rent Act of 1947 was a temporary measure enacted with the object of continuing during a limited period the powers to control the letting and the rent of residential and non residential accommodation and to prevent the evic tion of tenants from the same.\nThe relevant portion of sub section (1) of section 3 of that Act runs as follows: 565 \"3.\nRestrictions on eviction.\n(1) Subject to any order passed under sub section (3) no suit shall, without the permis sion of the District Magistrate, be filed in any civil court against a tenant for his eviction from any accommodation, except on one or more of the following grounds:\" Thereafter, clauses (a) to (g) set out the grounds on which a suit for eviction could be filed without the permission of the District Magistrate.\nSub section (2) of section 3 pro vides for an application for revision against the order of the District Magistrate granting or refusing the grant of permission to file a suit for eviction of a tenant to the Commissioner.\nSub section (4) provides that the order of the Commissioner made in such revision application as set out above, shall be subject to any order passed by the State Government under section 7F of that Act.\nSub section (d) of section 2 of the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 gives an inclusive definition of the term \"District Magistrate\" ,red states that the said term would include an officer authorised by the District Magistrate to perform any of his functions under that Act.\nThe U.P. Rent Act of 1972 was enacted to make provisions in the interest of the general public for the regulation of letting and rent of, and the eviction of tenants from, certain classes of buildings situated in the urban areas.\nSection 21 of this Act provides for release of a building under occupation of the tenants, that is, very briefly, for the eviction of tenants from the buildings under tenancy and also inter alia prescribes grounds on which such eviction can be ordered.\nIt may be mentioned that eviction of tenants is not permitted except on prescribed grounds.\nSection 43 of the U.P. Rent Act of 1972 provides for repeal and savings.\nUnder sub section (1) of that sec tion the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 is repealed.\nThe relevant portion of sub section (2) of section 43 of the U.P. Rent Act of 1972 which is in the nature of a savings provision runs as follows: \"43 Repeal and savings.\n(1) x x x x (2) Notwithstanding such repeal X X X (rr) where any permission referred to in section 3 of the 566 old Act has been obtained on any ground speci fied in subsection (1) or sub section (2) of section 21, and has become final, either before the commencement of this Act, or in accordance with the provisions of this sub section, after the commencement of this Act, whether or not a suit for the eviction of the tenant has been instituted, the landlord may apply to the prescribed authority for his eviction under section 21, and thereupon the prescribed authority shall order the eviction of the tenant from the building under tenancy, and it shall not be necessary for the pre scribed authority to satisfy itself afresh as to the existence of any ground as aforesaid, and such order shall be final and shall not be open to appeal under section 22\".\nThe provisos to the clause are not relevant for our purpose.\nThe main contention of the learned counsel for respond ent No. 2 before us was that in view of the provisions of clause (rr) of sub section (2) of section 43 of the U.P. Rent Act of 1972, once the permission to file the suit for eviction was granted by the authorities concerned under the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 and that permission was on a ground specified in sub section (1) or sub section (2) of section 21 of the U.P. Rent Act of 1972, it was not open to the Prescribed Authority before which the application for evic tion was filed to reconsider the same.\nThe Prescribed Au thority, in the present case, has tried to analyse that permission and declined to grant the decree for eviction on the basis that the permission was conditional and the land lord was not willing to carry out those conditions.\nIn our view, the question of the authority under the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 having imposed any condition, does not arise at all.\nA plain reading of the order of the Rent Controller and Eviction Officer, Bijnor as well as the orders of the Com missioner in revision and that of the State Government makes it clear that the permission given to the landlord to file the suit was not subject to any condition at all.\nAt the same time, the judgment of the Rent Controller clearly shows that one d the circumstances which constituted the basis for the grant of the permission to file the ,suit for eviction was that the landlord gave an assurance cum undertaking to give newly constructed shops to the tenants sought to be evicted including the tenant before us and that the landlord also gave a similar assurance to give alternative accommoda tion to the tenant during the period which would be taken in completing the new construction.\nAs we have already pointed out, the petition for permission to file a suit, flied before the Rent Controller by the landlord, in terms, con tained an 567 assurance cum undertaking that the landlord would give the newly constructed shops after the new shops were constructed to the tenants sought to be evicted on a reasonable rent.\nIt appears that the offer to provide for alternative accommoda tion during the period when the new construction was coming up was made by the landlord in the course of the hearing before the said Eviction Officer, Bijnor.\nThe revision petition against that said order was dismissed by the Com missioner, Rukhilkhand Division, as we have already pointed out earlier.\nThe order passed under section 7F of the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 by the State Government also dismissed the revision petition preferred by the tenant to the State Government.\nThe order of the State Government which was passed on behalf of the Governor of the State by the Special Secretary, however, clearly notes that the landlord had given an undertaking to the tenants that they would be giving the newly constructed shops to them on standard and that during the period taken up in completing the new con struCtion, alternative accommodation would also be given to them.\nHowever, no condition in this connection was imposed by the State Government on the permission to file the suit for eviction.\nUnder these circumstances, we propose to proceed on the assumption that the High Court was justified in coming to the conclusion that the Prescribed Authority under the U.P. Rent Act of 1972 had no jurisdiction to go behind the permission granted by the relevant authorities under the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 for the filing of the eviC tion suit.\nHowever, it appears to us that the High Court was, with respect, in error in not taking into account the undertakings cumassurance given by the landlord to the tenant in his application for permission to file a suit as well as in the course of the hearing before the aforemen tioned authorities.\nWe do not find anything in the provi sions of seCtion 43(2) (rr) of the U.P. Rent Act of 1972 which would enable the landlord to evade his duty to comply with the undertakings cum assurances given by him.\nThese undertakings cum assurances givenby the landlord certainly formed part of the basis on which the permission to file the suit for eviCtion was unconditionally given to him.\nIt is but fair that the court should see to it that the tenant is not deprived of the benefit of the undertakingscum assur ances.\nIn fact, no good reason has been shown as to how the landlord can justly claim that he is no longer bound by the undertakingscum assurances given by him as set out earlier.\nIn these circumstances, we set aside the order of the High Court and pass the following order in its place: (1) We direct that the Prescribed Authority, Nagina, District Bijnor, to pass an order of eviCtion against the appellant tenant before us but the ' Prescribed Authority will give the necessary directions or 568 orders to respondent No. 2 landlord to provide alternative accommodation to the appellant during the period when the new construction is coming up and also pass appropriate orders for ensuring that after the new construction is completed, a comparable shop is given to the appellant herein.\n(2) In order not to delay the construction of the new shops, the Prescribed Authority may provide that, in case the landlord fails to or is unable to provide alternative accommodation to the appellanttenant during the period when the new construction is being completed, he shall pay a certain sum as fixed by the Prescribed Authority per month to the appellant tenant which would be reasonably adequate to enable that tenant to obtain alternative accommodation for that period.\nFor the aforesaid purpose, the Prescribed Authority may give such directions as it may think fit.\nBefore parting with the matter, we may refer to two decisions which were cited before us.\nThe first of these is the decision of a Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Asa Singh vs B.D. Sanwal & Ors., AIR 1969 All. 474.\nThe Full Bench of that High Court inter alia held in that case that while granting permission under section 3 of the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 the District Magistrate was bound to consider also the need of the tenant for the accommodation, if such a case is set up by the tenant.\nThis case was cited by the learned counsel for the tenant.\nLearned counsel for respond ent No. 2, on the other hand, cited the decision of another Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Bansilal Sahu vs The Prescribed Authority & Anr., AIR 1980 All. 194 which, very briefly stated, laid down that the Prescribed Authority under the U.P. Rent Act of 1972 is bound while acting under clause (rr) of section 43(2) of the said Act, irrespective of the occurrence of subsequent events, to order eviction according to the permission granted by the Prescribed Au thority under section 3 of the U.P. Rent Act of 1947.\nIn our view, it is not necessary for us to enter into a discussion of either of the authorities because they do not touch upon the question which has arisen before us, namely, enforcing the undertakings cumassurances given by the land lord in obtaining the permission under section 3 of the U.P. Rent Act of 1947.\nThe Appeal is allowed to the extent aforestated.\nLooking to the facts and circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.\nR.N.J. Appeal allowed.\n",
    "summary": "In 1959 the landlord filed an application under section 3(1) of the U.P.

Rent Act of 1972, it was not open to the Prescribed Authority before which the application for evic tion was filed to reconsider the same.\nThe Prescribed Au thority, in the present case, has tried to analyse that permission and declined to grant the decree for eviction on the basis that the permission was conditional and the land lord was not willing to carry out those conditions.\nIn our view, the question of the authority under the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 having imposed any condition, does not arise at all.\nA plain reading of the order of the Rent Controller and Eviction Officer, Bijnor as well as the orders of the Com missioner in revision and that of the State Government makes it clear that the permission given to the landlord to file the suit was not subject to any condition at all.\nAt the same time, the judgment of the Rent Controller clearly shows that one d the circumstances which constituted the basis for the grant of the permission to file the ,suit for eviction was that the landlord gave an assurance cum undertaking to give newly constructed shops to the tenants sought to be evicted including the tenant before us and that the landlord also gave a similar assurance to give alternative accommoda tion to the tenant during the period which would be taken in completing the new construction.\nAs we have already pointed out, the petition for permission to file a suit, flied before the Rent Controller by the landlord, in terms, con tained an 567 assurance cum undertaking that the landlord would give the newly constructed shops after the new shops were constructed to the tenants sought to be evicted on a reasonable rent.\nIt appears that the offer to provide for alternative accommoda tion during the period when the new construction was coming up was made by the landlord in the course of the hearing before the said Eviction Officer, Bijnor.\nThe revision petition against that said order was dismissed by the Com missioner, Rukhilkhand Division, as we have already pointed out earlier.\nThe order passed under section 7F of the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 by the State Government also dismissed the revision petition preferred by the tenant to the State Government.\nThe order of the State Government which was passed on behalf of the Governor of the State by the Special Secretary, however, clearly notes that the landlord had given an undertaking to the tenants that they would be giving the newly constructed shops to them on standard and that during the period taken up in completing the new con struCtion, alternative accommodation would also be given to them.\nHowever, no condition in this connection was imposed by the State Government on the permission to file the suit for eviction.\nUnder these circumstances, we propose to proceed on the assumption that the High Court was justified in coming to the conclusion that the Prescribed Authority under the U.P. Rent Act of 1972 had no jurisdiction to go behind the permission granted by the relevant authorities under the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 for the filing of the eviC tion suit.\nHowever, it appears to us that the High Court was, with respect, in error in not taking into account the undertakings cumassurance given by the landlord to the tenant in his application for permission to file a suit as well as in the course of the hearing before the aforemen tioned authorities.\nWe do not find anything in the provi sions of seCtion 43(2) (rr) of the U.P. Rent Act of 1972 which would enable the landlord to evade his duty to comply with the undertakings cum assurances given by him.\nThese undertakings cum assurances givenby the landlord certainly formed part of the basis on which the permission to file the suit for eviCtion was unconditionally given to him.\nIt is but fair that the court should see to it that the tenant is not deprived of the benefit of the undertakingscum assur ances.\nIn fact, no good reason has been shown as to how the landlord can justly claim that he is no longer bound by the undertakingscum assurances given by him as set out earlier.\nIn these circumstances, we set aside the order of the High Court and pass the following order in its place: (1) We direct that the Prescribed Authority, Nagina, District Bijnor, to pass an order of eviCtion against the appellant tenant before us but the ' Prescribed Authority will give the necessary directions or 568 orders to respondent No. 2 landlord to provide alternative accommodation to the appellant during the period when the new construction is coming up and also pass appropriate orders for ensuring that after the new construction is completed, a comparable shop is given to the appellant herein.\n(2) In order not to delay the construction of the new shops, the Prescribed Authority may provide that, in case the landlord fails to or is unable to provide alternative accommodation to the appellanttenant during the period when the new construction is being completed, he shall pay a certain sum as fixed by the Prescribed Authority per month to the appellant tenant which would be reasonably adequate to enable that tenant to obtain alternative accommodation for that period.\nFor the aforesaid purpose, the Prescribed Authority may give such directions as it may think fit.\nBefore parting with the matter, we may refer to two decisions which were cited before us.\nThe first of these is the decision of a Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Asa Singh vs B.D. Sanwal & Ors., AIR 1969 All. 474.\nThe Full Bench of that High Court inter alia held in that case that while granting permission under section 3 of the U.P. Rent Act of 1947 the District Magistrate was bound to consider also the need of the tenant for the accommodation, if such a case is set up by the tenant.\nThis case was cited by the learned counsel for the tenant.\nLearned counsel for respond ent No. 2, on the other hand, cited the decision of another Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Bansilal Sahu vs The Prescribed Authority & Anr., AIR 1980 All. 194 which, very briefly stated, laid down that the Prescribed Authority under the U.P. Rent Act of 1972 is bound while acting under clause (rr) of section 43(2) of the said Act, irrespective of the occurrence of subsequent events, to order eviction according to the permission granted by the Prescribed Au thority under section 3 of the U.P. Rent Act of 1947.\nIn our view, it is not necessary for us to enter into a discussion of either of the authorities because they do not touch upon the question which has arisen before us, namely, enforcing the undertakings cumassurances given by the land lord in obtaining the permission under section 3 of the U.P. Rent Act of 1947.\nThe Appeal is allowed to the extent aforestated.\nLooking to the facts and circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.\nR.N.J. Appeal allowed.\n",

Kapur for the Petitioner.\nSoli J. Sorabjee, Harsh Mittre, Harish N. Salve, Jeel Peres, D.N. Mishra and Mrs. A.K. Verma for the Respondents.\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by SABYASACHI MUKHARJI, J.\nThis petition under Article 136 of the Constitution challenges the judgment and order of the Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay dated 21st March, 1988.\nThe petitioner in this case on 23rd June, 1961, had agreed to sell to the predecessor of respondent raw petroleum coke.\nThere was a second agreement on 22nd April, 1971.\nThe said agreement was arrived at between the parties whereunder it was provided that in case the respondent failed to lift raw petroleum coke as agreed, the petitioner would have right to shift raw petroleum coke at the risk and expense of the respondent.\nThere was a third agreement providing that in case of delay in payment, the respondent would pay interest at 4 per cent over the I.O.C. Bank borrowing rate, on the value of the stock not uplifted.\nIt appears that on 5th August, 1982, the respondent wrote a letter to the petitioner showing inability to pay the arrears of the price against delivery of raw petroleum coke.\nOn 4th October, 1982 there was a stock of about 13,760 M.T.S. Of saleable raw petroleum coke lying at Gauhati Refinery.\nThe petitioner on 18th October, 1982 wrote to the 429 respondent that unless the outstandings as on 1st September, 1982 and interest were paid, the petitioner would not make further supplies.\nThereafter the petitioner filed Suit No. 2187 of 1982 for payment and for attachment before judgment.\nOn 21st December, 1982, it appears that there was an order of attachment of stocks of raw petroleum coke to the extent of Rs.6 crores of the respondent.\nThe order was confirmed after notice.\nRespondent filed Appeal No. 858 of 1983.\nThereafter respondent on 20th ostler, 1983 filed an application for stay of the suit under section 34 of the (hereinafter called 'the Act ').\nThe petitioner on 11th July, 1983 terminated the agreement with effect from 31.8.83.\nThe respondent thereafter filed Suit No. 122 of 1983 and applied for an order compelling the petitioner to make supplies.\nThe learned District Judge passed an order on 28th April, 1984 for restoration of supplies.\nOn 7th May, 1984 in petitioner 's appeal viz., Civil Appeal No. 2476 of 1984, this Court stayed the above order.\nOn 24th May, 1984 this Court 's order setting aside the order of the learned District Judge dated 28th April, 1984 and recorded the compromise terms.\nPursuant to the compromise, all proceedings were withdrawn by the parties.\nOn 11th December, 1984 matter relating to the petitioner 's claims in respect of interest on stocks held from 1st October, 1982 onwards and expenses of shifting raw petroleum coke from 1st October, 1982 upto 31st August, 1983, were referred to arbitration of Shri A.K. Sarkar, a former Chief Justice of India.\nOn 21st August, 1986 an interim award was passed by the learned arbitrator.\nInterim award was filed in the High Court of Bombay and the petitioner challenged the said award.\nThe learned single Judge of the High Court dismissed the petition challenging the interim award.\nThe Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay upheld the order of the learned single Judge.\nHence this petition under Article 136 of the Constitution.\nThe main contention urged before us was that it was necessary in the present trend of law for the learned arbitrator to have given a reasoned award.\nThe Arbitration Act, 1979 in England so enjoins.\nThe arbitrator, according to the petitioner has failed to do so.\nHence the award was bad and as such the decision of the High Court was wrong and leave should be granted from the said decision and the matter be referred to the Constitution Bench as several cases are pending on this point.\nThe learned single Judge of the High Court in his decision had observed that the award was undoubtedly not an elaborately reasoned award setting out all the reasons which prompted the learned arbitrator to arrive at the conclusion he did reach, but it was a speaking 430 award.\nThe learned Judge however, held that it was not necessary to examine this aspect since even if it was a speaking order, it was not bad in law.\nIt is true that the law as it stands upto date since the decision of Champsey Bhara and Company vs Jivraj Balloo Spinning and Weaving Company Ltd., A.I.R. 1923 P.C. 66 that it was not necessary that all awards should be speaking awards.\nSee in this connection the observations of this Court in Hindustan Steelworks Construction Ltd. vs Shri C.Rajasekhar Rao, 3 S.C. 239.\nPreviously the law both in England and India was that an arbitrator 's award might be set aside for error of law appearing on the face of it, though the jurisdiction was not lightly to be exercised.\nSince question of law could always be dealt with by means of a special case this is one matter that could be taken into account when deciding whether the jurisdiction to set aside an award on this ground should be exercised or not.\nThe jurisdiction was one that existed at common law independently of statute.\nIn order to be a ground for setting aside the award, an error in law on the face of the award must be such that there could be found in the award, or in any document actually incorporated with it, some legal proposition which was the basis of the award and which was erroneous.\nSee Halsbury 's Laws of England, 4th edition.\nparagraph 623, page 334.\nThe law has undergone a sea change in England.\nIt is obligatory in England now after the Arbitration Act, 979, that the award should give reasons.\nIn the instant case.\nthe arbitrator has set out the history in the interim award.\nThe arbitrator has stated that the agreement dated 22nd April.\n1970 provided that I.C.L. will uplift all available coke produced at the Gauhati Refinery by which name also the Noonmati Refinery was called.\nthe said upliftment being so regulated that the quantity uplifted every week was equivalent to the production of coke at the refinery in the previous week and that whereas it was thereby further provided that the upliftment by I.C.L. shall also be as regulated that the accumulated quantity of coke in the refinery coke yard does not fall below 2500 tons and does not exceed 4500 tons.\nThe other history of the matter, it was recited that the order dated 24th May, 1984 was passed by consent of the parties by this Court that the claim of the Indian oil Corporation for interest on stocks said to have been held in the Gauhati Refinery from 1st October, 1982 onwards and its claim for expenses of shifting the coke from 1st October, 1982 upto 3 1st August, 1983 would be referred to the arbitration of a retired Judge of the Supreme Court mutually acceptable to the parties.\nTwo preliminary issues, the arbitrator framed were, namely, (1) Is the 431 claimant entitled to charge any interest on unlifted stock of raw petroleum coke in view of its letter dated October 18, 1982? and (2) Is the claimant entitled to any shifting charges in view of its letter dated 18th October, 1982? The gist of the letter dated 18th October, 1982 is set out in the arbitration agreement.\nThe arbitrator in his award pro to observe as follows: \"And whereas it is not in dispute between the parties that since the said letter of 18th October, 1982, I.O.C. had not delivered or offered to deliver any raw petroleum coke for I.C.L. Now, therefore, having heard counsel for the parties and perused the documents and statements filed by them, the despatch and receipt of none of which is disputed, and having considered thereafter, I adjudge, hold and award as follows: The letter dated 18th October, 1982 is no bar to Indian oil Corporation 's claim for shifting charges and interest in respect of the period from 1st October, 1982 to 17th October, 1982.\nBecause of the said letter which has been admittedly acted upon by the Indian oil Corporation Ltd. which had not delivered any coke to Indian Carbon Ltd. Or made any offer to do so the Indian oil Corporation Ltd. is not entitled to the interest claimed in respect of the period from 18th October, 1982 onwards nor to shifting charges in respect of any shifting done on or after 18th October, 1982.\n\" The aforesaid grounds are the reasons of the arbitrator for making the award.\nThe award is that the Indian oil Corporation is not entitled to any interest nor any shifting charges.\nThe reasons for the said conclusion are the aforesaid three factors mentioned by the arbitrator.\nHow the arbitrator has drawn inference is apparent from the reasons.\nIt is to be noted that this Court has been insisting on the arbitrators to give some indications to indicate how the mind of the arbitrator acts.\nThis Court in the case of Siemens Engineering and Manufacturing Company of India Ltd. vs Union of India, was concerned with the decision of the Collector of Customs.\nThis Court observed that where an authority makes an order 432 in exercise of a quasi judicial function, it must record its reasons in support of the order it makes.\nThis Court observed further that every quasi judicial order must be supported by reasons.\nIn Rohtas Industries Ltd. and Another vs Rohtas Industries Staff Union and others; , where this Court was concerned with an award under section 10A of the .\nThis Court observed that there was a need for a speaking order where considerable numbers are affected in their substantial rights.\nIt was further reiterated that in such a situation a speaking order may well be a facet of natural justice or fair procedure.\nIn Dewan Singh vs Champat Singh, ; , this Court reiterated that it was an implied term of the arbitration agreement that the arbitrators must decide the dispute in accordance with the ordinary law and they cannot decide disputes on the basis of their personal knowledge.\nThe proceedings, it was held, before the arbitrators were quasi judicial proceedings and they must be conducted in accordance with the principles of natural justice.\nIt was, therefore, obligatory to give reasons.\nAs mentioned hereinbefore there has been since then trend that reasons should be stated in the award and the question whether the reasons are necessary in ordinary arbitration agreement between the parties has been referred to the Constituion Bench.\nIn this case, however, we are in agreement with the High Court of Bombay that reasons were stated in the award.\nWe have set out hereinbefore the three grounds, namely, (1) The letter dated 18th October, 1982 is no bar to Indian oil Corporation 's claim for shifting charges and interest in respect of the period from 1st October, 1982 to 17th October, 1982.\n(2) The inference drawn from the contents of the letter and (3) Because of the said letter which has admittedly been acted upon by the Indian oil Corporation Ltd., and which had not delivered any coke to the Indian Carbon Ltd. Or made any offer to do so.\nFor these reasons, the arbitrator held that the Indian oil Corporation Ltd., is not entitled to interest claimed in respect of the period from 18th October, 1982 onwards nor to shifting charges from 18th October, 1982.\nThese are the reasons for giving the award.\nNo error of law was pointed out in those reasons.\nIndeed no proposition of law was stated in the aforesaid reasons, which could be objected to as an error of law.\nThere was, however, no error of fact.\nIt was a possible view to take.\nIt could not be urged that it was an impossible view to take.\nThe arbitrator has made his mind known on the basis of which he has acted that, in our opinion, is sufficient to meet the requirements even if it be reasons should be stated in the award.\nIt is one thing to say that 433 reasons should be stated and another thing to state that a detailed judgment to be given in support of an award.\nEven if it be held that it is obligatory to state the reasons, it is not obligatory to give a detailed judgment.\nThis question was considered by the Court of Appeal in England in Bremer Handelsgesellschaft vs Westzucker, [1981] 2 Lloyd 's Law Reports 130.\nThere Lord Donaldson speaking for the court at pages 132 and 133 of the report observed as follows: \"It is of the greatest importance that trade arbitrators working under the 1979 Act should realize that their whole approach should now be different.\nAt the end of the hearing they will be in a position to give a decision and the reasons for that decision.\nThey should do so at the earliest possible moment.\nThe parties will have made their submissions as to what actually happened and what is the result in terms of their respective rights and liabilities.\nAll this will be fresh in the arbitrators ' minds and there will be no need for further written submission by the parties.\nNo particular form of award is required.\nCertainly no one wants a formal \"Special Case\".\nAll that is necessary is that the arbitrators should set out what, on their view of the evidence, did or did not happen and should explain succinctly why, in the light of what happened, they have reached their decision and what that decision is.\nThis is all that is meant by a \"reasoned award\".\nFor example, it may be convenient to begin by explaining briefly how the arbitration came about \"X sold to Y 200 tons of soyabean meal on the terms of GAFTA Contract 100 at US.\n$Z per ton c.i.f.\nBremen.\nX claimed damages for non delivery and we were appointed arbitrators\".\nThe award could then briefly tell the factual story as the arbitrators saw it.\nMuch would be common ground and would need no elaboration.\nBut when the award comes to matters in controversy, it would be helpful if the arbitrators not only gave their view of what occurred, but also made it clear that they have considered any alternative version and have rejected it, e.g., \"The shippers claimed that they shipped 100 tons at the end of June.\nWe are not satisified that this is so\", or as the case may be.\n\"We are satisfied that this was not the case\".\nThe arbitrators should end with their conclusion as to the resulting rights and liabilities of the parties.\nThere is nothing about 434 this which is remotely technical, difficult or time consuming.\nIt is sometimes said that this involves arbitrators in delivering judgments and that this is something which requires legal skills.\nThis is something of a half truth.\nMuch of the art of giving a judgment lies in telling a story logically, coherently and accurately.\nThis is something which requires skill, but it is not a legal skill and it is not necessarily advanced by legal training.\nIt is certainly a judicial skill, but arbitrators for this purpose are Judges and will have no difficulty in acquiring it.\nWhere a 1979 Act award differs from a judgment is in the fact that the arbitrators will not be expected to analyse the law and the authorities.\nIt will be quite sufficient that they should explain how they reached their conclusion, e.g., \"We regarded the conduct of the buyers, as we have described it, as constituting a repudiation of their obligations under the contract and the subsequent conduct of the sellers, also as described, as amounting to an acceptance of that repudiatory conduct putting an end to the contract\".\nIt can be left to others to argue that this is wrong in law and to a professional Judge, if leave to appeal is given, to analyse the authorities.\nThis is not to say that where arbitrators are content to set out their reasoning on questions of law in the same way as Judges, this will be unwelcome to the Courts.\nFar from it.\nThe point which I am seeking to make is that a reasoned award, in accordance with the 1979 Act, is wholly different from an award in the form of a special case.\nIt is not technical, it is not difficult to draw and above all it is something which can and should be produced promptly and quickly at the conclusion of the hearing.\nThat is the time when it is easiest to produce an award with all the issues in mind.\n\" See the observations in Russel on Arbitration, 20th Edn., page 291 Reasons for the Award and the decision referred to therein.\n\" In a case of this nature, issues are simple, points are fresh and facts are clear, the reasons given by the arbitrator, in our opinion, meet the requirements of a reasoned award.\nIt is apparent that the arbitrator has not acted irrelevantly or unreasonably.\nArbitration procedure should be quick and that quickness of the decision can always be ensured by insisting that short intelligible indications of the grounds 435 should be available to find out the mind of the arbitrator for his action.\nThis was possible in the instant case.\nIn the instant case the arbitrator has spoken his mind, and he is clear as to how he acted and why he acted in that manner.\nThe purpose of section 12 of the English Tribunal and Inquiries Act which required the statutory tribunal to furnish a statement of the reasons if requested to do so before it gave its decision was to enable a person whose property or whose interests were affected to know if the decision was against him what the reasons were.\nJustice R.S. Bachawat in his Law of Arbitration, First Edition 1983, pages 320 and 321 states that the provision was read as meaning that proper and adequate reasons must be given.\nThe reasons that are set out must be reasons which will not only be intelligible but also deal with the substantial points that have been raised.\nWhen the arbitration clause required the arbitrator to give a reasoned award and the arbitrator does give his reasons in the award, the sufficiency of the reasons depend upon the facts of the particular case.\nHe is not bound to give detailed reasons.\nThe Court does not sit in appeal over the award and review the reasons.\nThe Court can set aside the award only if it is apparent from the award that there is no evidence to support the conclusions or if the award is based upon any legal proposition which is erroneous.\nJudges in that light, the award in question was unassailable in the instant case.\nIn the aforesaid view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the High Court was right in the view it took.\nThe special leave petition fails and is accordingly dismissed.\nG.N. Petition dismissed.\n",

Of saleable raw petroleum coke lying at Gauhati Refinery.\nThe petitioner on 18th October, 1982 wrote to the 429 respondent that unless the outstandings as on 1st September, 1982 and interest were paid, the petitioner would not make further supplies.\nThereafter the petitioner filed Suit No. 2187 of 1982 for payment and for attachment before judgment.\nOn 21st December, 1982, it appears that there was an order of attachment of stocks of raw petroleum coke to the extent of Rs.6 crores of the respondent.\nThe order was confirmed after notice.\nRespondent filed Appeal No. 858 of 1983.\nThereafter respondent on 20th ostler, 1983 filed an application for stay of the suit under section 34 of the (hereinafter called 'the Act ').\nThe petitioner on 11th July, 1983 terminated the agreement with effect from 31.8.83.\nThe respondent thereafter filed Suit No. 122 of 1983 and applied for an order compelling the petitioner to make supplies.\nThe learned District Judge passed an order on 28th April, 1984 for restoration of supplies.\nOn 7th May, 1984 in petitioner 's appeal viz., Civil Appeal No. 2476 of 1984, this Court stayed the above order.\nOn 24th May, 1984 this Court 's order setting aside the order of the learned District Judge dated 28th April, 1984 and recorded the compromise terms.\nPursuant to the compromise, all proceedings were withdrawn by the parties.\nOn 11th December, 1984 matter relating to the petitioner 's claims in respect of interest on stocks held from 1st October, 1982 onwards and expenses of shifting raw petroleum coke from 1st October, 1982 upto 31st August, 1983, were referred to arbitration of Shri A.K. Sarkar, a former Chief Justice of India.\nOn 21st August, 1986 an interim award was passed by the learned arbitrator.\nInterim award was filed in the High Court of Bombay and the petitioner challenged the said award.\nThe learned single Judge of the High Court dismissed the petition challenging the interim award.\nThe Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay upheld the order of the learned single Judge.\nHence this petition under Article 136 of the Constitution.\nThe main contention urged before us was that it was necessary in the present trend of law for the learned arbitrator to have given a reasoned award.\nThe Arbitration Act, 1979 in England so enjoins.\nThe arbitrator, according to the petitioner has failed to do so.\nHence the award was bad and as such the decision of the High Court was wrong and leave should be granted from the said decision and the matter be referred to the Constitution Bench as several cases are pending on this point.\nThe learned single Judge of the High Court in his decision had observed that the award was undoubtedly not an elaborately reasoned award setting out all the reasons which prompted the learned arbitrator to arrive at the conclusion he did reach, but it was a speaking 430 award.\nThe learned Judge however, held that it was not necessary to examine this aspect since even if it was a speaking order, it was not bad in law.\nIt is true that the law as it stands upto date since the decision of Champsey Bhara and Company vs Jivraj Balloo Spinning and Weaving Company Ltd., A.I.R. 1923 P.C. 66 that it was not necessary that all awards should be speaking awards.\nSee in this connection the observations of this Court in Hindustan Steelworks Construction Ltd. vs Shri C.Rajasekhar Rao, 3 S.C. 239.\nPreviously the law both in England and India was that an arbitrator 's award might be set aside for error of law appearing on the face of it, though the jurisdiction was not lightly to be exercised.\nSince question of law could always be dealt with by means of a special case this is one matter that could be taken into account when deciding whether the jurisdiction to set aside an award on this ground should be exercised or not.\nThe jurisdiction was one that existed at common law independently of statute.\nIn order to be a ground for setting aside the award, an error in law on the face of the award must be such that there could be found in the award, or in any document actually incorporated with it, some legal proposition which was the basis of the award and which was erroneous.\nSee Halsbury 's Laws of England, 4th edition.\nparagraph 623, page 334.\nThe law has undergone a sea change in England.\nIt is obligatory in England now after the Arbitration Act, 979, that the award should give reasons.\nIn the instant case.\nthe arbitrator has set out the history in the interim award.\nThe arbitrator has stated that the agreement dated 22nd April.\n1970 provided that I.C.L. will uplift all available coke produced at the Gauhati Refinery by which name also the Noonmati Refinery was called.\nthe said upliftment being so regulated that the quantity uplifted every week was equivalent to the production of coke at the refinery in the previous week and that whereas it was thereby further provided that the upliftment by I.C.L. shall also be as regulated that the accumulated quantity of coke in the refinery coke yard does not fall below 2500 tons and does not exceed 4500 tons.\nThe other history of the matter, it was recited that the order dated 24th May, 1984 was passed by consent of the parties by this Court that the claim of the Indian oil Corporation for interest on stocks said to have been held in the Gauhati Refinery from 1st October, 1982 onwards and its claim for expenses of shifting the coke from 1st October, 1982 upto 3 1st August, 1983 would be referred to the arbitration of a retired Judge of the Supreme Court mutually acceptable to the parties.\nTwo preliminary issues, the arbitrator framed were, namely, (1) Is the 431 claimant entitled to charge any interest on unlifted stock of raw petroleum coke in view of its letter dated October 18, 1982? and (2) Is the claimant entitled to any shifting charges in view of its letter dated 18th October, 1982? The gist of the letter dated 18th October, 1982 is set out in the arbitration agreement.\nThe arbitrator in his award pro to observe as follows: \"And whereas it is not in dispute between the parties that since the said letter of 18th October, 1982, I.O.C. had not delivered or offered to deliver any raw petroleum coke for I.C.L. Now, therefore, having heard counsel for the parties and perused the documents and statements filed by them, the despatch and receipt of none of which is disputed, and having considered thereafter, I adjudge, hold and award as follows: The letter dated 18th October, 1982 is no bar to Indian oil Corporation 's claim for shifting charges and interest in respect of the period from 1st October, 1982 to 17th October, 1982.\nBecause of the said letter which has been admittedly acted upon by the Indian oil Corporation Ltd. which had not delivered any coke to Indian Carbon Ltd. Or made any offer to do so the Indian oil Corporation Ltd. is not entitled to the interest claimed in respect of the period from 18th October, 1982 onwards nor to shifting charges in respect of any shifting done on or after 18th October, 1982.\n\" The aforesaid grounds are the reasons of the arbitrator for making the award.\nThe award is that the Indian oil Corporation is not entitled to any interest nor any shifting charges.\nThe reasons for the said conclusion are the aforesaid three factors mentioned by the arbitrator.\nHow the arbitrator has drawn inference is apparent from the reasons.\nIt is to be noted that this Court has been insisting on the arbitrators to give some indications to indicate how the mind of the arbitrator acts.\nThis Court in the case of Siemens Engineering and Manufacturing Company of India Ltd. vs Union of India, was concerned with the decision of the Collector of Customs.\nThis Court observed that where an authority makes an order 432 in exercise of a quasi judicial function, it must record its reasons in support of the order it makes.\nThis Court observed further that every quasi judicial order must be supported by reasons.\nIn Rohtas Industries Ltd. and Another vs Rohtas Industries Staff Union and others; , where this Court was concerned with an award under section 10A of the .\nThis Court observed that there was a need for a speaking order where considerable numbers are affected in their substantial rights.\nIt was further reiterated that in such a situation a speaking order may well be a facet of natural justice or fair procedure.\nIn Dewan Singh vs Champat Singh, ; , this Court reiterated that it was an implied term of the arbitration agreement that the arbitrators must decide the dispute in accordance with the ordinary law and they cannot decide disputes on the basis of their personal knowledge.\nThe proceedings, it was held, before the arbitrators were quasi judicial proceedings and they must be conducted in accordance with the principles of natural justice.\nIt was, therefore, obligatory to give reasons.\nAs mentioned hereinbefore there has been since then trend that reasons should be stated in the award and the question whether the reasons are necessary in ordinary arbitration agreement between the parties has been referred to the Constituion Bench.\nIn this case, however, we are in agreement with the High Court of Bombay that reasons were stated in the award.\nWe have set out hereinbefore the three grounds, namely, (1) The letter dated 18th October, 1982 is no bar to Indian oil Corporation 's claim for shifting charges and interest in respect of the period from 1st October, 1982 to 17th October, 1982.\n(2) The inference drawn from the contents of the letter and (3) Because of the said letter which has admittedly been acted upon by the Indian oil Corporation Ltd., and which had not delivered any coke to the Indian Carbon Ltd. Or made any offer to do so.\nFor these reasons, the arbitrator held that the Indian oil Corporation Ltd., is not entitled to interest claimed in respect of the period from 18th October, 1982 onwards nor to shifting charges from 18th October, 1982.\nThese are the reasons for giving the award.\nNo error of law was pointed out in those reasons.\nIndeed no proposition of law was stated in the aforesaid reasons, which could be objected to as an error of law.\nThere was, however, no error of fact.\nIt was a possible view to take.\nIt could not be urged that it was an impossible view to take.\nThe arbitrator has made his mind known on the basis of which he has acted that, in our opinion, is sufficient to meet the requirements even if it be reasons should be stated in the award.\nIt is one thing to say that 433 reasons should be stated and another thing to state that a detailed judgment to be given in support of an award.\nEven if it be held that it is obligatory to state the reasons, it is not obligatory to give a detailed judgment.\nThis question was considered by the Court of Appeal in England in Bremer Handelsgesellschaft vs Westzucker, [1981] 2 Lloyd 's Law Reports 130.\nThere Lord Donaldson speaking for the court at pages 132 and 133 of the report observed as follows: \"It is of the greatest importance that trade arbitrators working under the 1979 Act should realize that their whole approach should now be different.\nAt the end of the hearing they will be in a position to give a decision and the reasons for that decision.\nThey should do so at the earliest possible moment.\nThe parties will have made their submissions as to what actually happened and what is the result in terms of their respective rights and liabilities.\nAll this will be fresh in the arbitrators ' minds and there will be no need for further written submission by the parties.\nNo particular form of award is required.\nCertainly no one wants a formal \"Special Case\".\nAll that is necessary is that the arbitrators should set out what, on their view of the evidence, did or did not happen and should explain succinctly why, in the light of what happened, they have reached their decision and what that decision is.\nThis is all that is meant by a \"reasoned award\".\nFor example, it may be convenient to begin by explaining briefly how the arbitration came about \"X sold to Y 200 tons of soyabean meal on the terms of GAFTA Contract 100 at US.\n$Z per ton c.i.f.\nBremen.\nX claimed damages for non delivery and we were appointed arbitrators\".\nThe award could then briefly tell the factual story as the arbitrators saw it.\nMuch would be common ground and would need no elaboration.\nBut when the award comes to matters in controversy, it would be helpful if the arbitrators not only gave their view of what occurred, but also made it clear that they have considered any alternative version and have rejected it, e.g., \"The shippers claimed that they shipped 100 tons at the end of June.\nWe are not satisified that this is so\", or as the case may be.\n\"We are satisfied that this was not the case\".\nThe arbitrators should end with their conclusion as to the resulting rights and liabilities of the parties.\nThere is nothing about 434 this which is remotely technical, difficult or time consuming.\nIt is sometimes said that this involves arbitrators in delivering judgments and that this is something which requires legal skills.\nThis is something of a half truth.\nMuch of the art of giving a judgment lies in telling a story logically, coherently and accurately.\nThis is something which requires skill, but it is not a legal skill and it is not necessarily advanced by legal training.\nIt is certainly a judicial skill, but arbitrators for this purpose are Judges and will have no difficulty in acquiring it.\nWhere a 1979 Act award differs from a judgment is in the fact that the arbitrators will not be expected to analyse the law and the authorities.\nIt will be quite sufficient that they should explain how they reached their conclusion, e.g., \"We regarded the conduct of the buyers, as we have described it, as constituting a repudiation of their obligations under the contract and the subsequent conduct of the sellers, also as described, as amounting to an acceptance of that repudiatory conduct putting an end to the contract\".\nIt can be left to others to argue that this is wrong in law and to a professional Judge, if leave to appeal is given, to analyse the authorities.\nThis is not to say that where arbitrators are content to set out their reasoning on questions of law in the same way as Judges, this will be unwelcome to the Courts.\nFar from it.\nThe point which I am seeking to make is that a reasoned award, in accordance with the 1979 Act, is wholly different from an award in the form of a special case.\nIt is not technical, it is not difficult to draw and above all it is something which can and should be produced promptly and quickly at the conclusion of the hearing.\nThat is the time when it is easiest to produce an award with all the issues in mind.\n\" See the observations in Russel on Arbitration, 20th Edn., page 291 Reasons for the Award and the decision referred to therein.\n\" In a case of this nature, issues are simple, points are fresh and facts are clear, the reasons given by the arbitrator, in our opinion, meet the requirements of a reasoned award.\nIt is apparent that the arbitrator has not acted irrelevantly or unreasonably.\nArbitration procedure should be quick and that quickness of the decision can always be ensured by insisting that short intelligible indications of the grounds 435 should be available to find out the mind of the arbitrator for his action.\nThis was possible in the instant case.\nIn the instant case the arbitrator has spoken his mind, and he is clear as to how he acted and why he acted in that manner.\nThe purpose of section 12 of the English Tribunal and Inquiries Act which required the statutory tribunal to furnish a statement of the reasons if requested to do so before it gave its decision was to enable a person whose property or whose interests were affected to know if the decision was against him what the reasons were.\nJustice R.S. Bachawat in his Law of Arbitration, First Edition 1983, pages 320 and 321 states that the provision was read as meaning that proper and adequate reasons must be given.\nThe reasons that are set out must be reasons which will not only be intelligible but also deal with the substantial points that have been raised.\nWhen the arbitration clause required the arbitrator to give a reasoned award and the arbitrator does give his reasons in the award, the sufficiency of the reasons depend upon the facts of the particular case.\nHe is not bound to give detailed reasons.\nThe Court does not sit in appeal over the award and review the reasons.\nThe Court can set aside the award only if it is apparent from the award that there is no evidence to support the conclusions or if the award is based upon any legal proposition which is erroneous.\nJudges in that light, the award in question was unassailable in the instant case.\nIn the aforesaid view of the matter, we are of the opinion that the High Court was right in the view it took.\nThe special leave petition fails and is accordingly dismissed.\nG.N. Petition dismissed.\n",
